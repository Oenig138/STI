Mix thunderous spells (Shatter, Heat Metal) with Bardic Inspiration to keep fights cinematic and noisy.</li> <li>Joyful resilience: Treat every teleport (Cloud\u2019s Jaunt) or climb (Slippers of Spider Climbing at DM's discretion) as a chance for Yawp to crash through boundaries, physical or social. Why shrink back when you can double down? Have her teleport into the roof and fight upside down, playing the bagpipes. Yawp is all about movement and freedom.</li> <li>No such thing as retreat: Try to frame fleeing from combat as \"charging, but in a new and more fun direction\". </li> </ul> DM Guidance <ul> <li>Test her freedom: Yawp\u2019s greatest fear is restraint, whether physical or institutional. Scenes that try to cage or silence her give players a chance to showcase her vulnerable sides, but also play out defiance and overcoming fears.</li> <li>Make the echoes matter: Her dream of shouting from the highest peak of the world is metaphor as much as quest hook. Let natural wonders, storms, or divine omens answer her voice in unexpected ways.</li> <li>Handle volume with care: In party dynamics, Yawp might overwhelm quieter PCs. Create outlets (concerts, rituals, public challenges) where her noise is celebrated, and leave quieter spaces where others can breathe.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"character_concepts/yelena-gagarina/","title":"Yelena Gagarina","text":"<p>\u201cBeg pardon for existing, m\u2019lady.

Play her as someone who doesn\u2019t waste words, but whose honesty carries weight. She's already made tremendous sacrifices for what she believes in, but she's not in the habit of flaunting her woes to the world. She's a good choice if you prefer a quieter character at the table.</li> <li>Flavor and respect: Her prosthetic arm and tinkering skill are story hooks. Mention upkeep, adjustments, or creative uses in play. Please consider the dynamics of playing a person with amputations at the table, with regards to a respectful representation. As a halfling monk with missing limbs she may raise a few eyebrows. Decide how you want her to handle this at the table.</li> <li>Table presence: She\u2019s not a spotlight hog, but when she speaks, it should land. Think of her as the party\u2019s quiet conscience, and sometimes, quiet fist.</li> <li>Yelena's macguffin: Yelena always has the opportunity to return the stolen Astral crystal. Every day she chooses not to is another day she chooses to be hunted down by the gnomish network. Consider how this weighs on Yelena as a character. Even though she's tough as nails, she may start becoming flat if you never show her faltering.</li> </ul> DM Guidance <ul> <li>The Blood-Sport Past: The gnomish network and its scrying games are rich antagonists. Use them for recurring threats or intrigue.  </li> <li>The Artifact: Yelena knows the secret location of the stolen Astral crystal that collapsed the broadcast. This can anchor a whole campaign arc.</li> <li>Mentor &amp; Prot\u00e9g\u00e9: Lidda Willowkin or Seraphina de Spanta can recur as allies, foils, or romantic entanglements. Play them to draw out Yelena\u2019s guarded heart, but remember to seek player consent before adding romantic interests.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"character_concepts/assets/Simeon%20wild-shape%20table/","title":"Simeon wild shape table","text":"Form Why He\u2019d Choose It His Commentary Reef Shark Fast swimmer, solid damage, thematic \u201cSea Prince\u201d vibe \u201cFine.
