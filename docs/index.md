# Steal These Ideas

<img src="assets/sti.png" alt="STI" width="300">

**Steal These Ideas**. I upload free, hopefully conceptually rich, and 100% officially licensed content for GMs and players alike. Right now it's mainly D&D stuff, and all I'm asking of you is to steal them if you like them.

Everything here is designed to be **plug-and-play** with minimal prep. Characters have been created on the dndbeyond official website, and on occasion I've had to take some liberties to fit it all into the official character sheets. 

On the **elephant in the room**: Yes, images have been generated with AI. This is my way to show my own vision of the vibes of the characters or the scenarios. You're welcome to have **strong opinions on this**. Please just remember that this is free stuff, and if you dislike any aspect of it, you are free to only take the parts that you want.
