# Steal These Ideas

<img src="assets/sti.png" alt="STI" width="300">

Welcome to **Steal These Ideas**, where I upload a bunch of free, hopefully conceptually rich, and 100% officially licensed content for GMs and players alike. Right now it's mainly D&D stuff, but hey, if you like something you see, you're free to steal it and do what you want with it.

Everything here is designed to be **plug-and-play** with minimal prep. Characters have been created on the dndbeyond official website, and at occasion I've had to take some liberties to fit it all into the character sheets.

> **Mission**: My mission statement, because suddenly that's a thing we're supposed to have, is to share narrative-driven, thematically charged resources that fit seamlessly into any table. 

On the **elephant in the room**: Yes, images have been generated with AI. This is my way to show my own vision of the vibes of the characters or the scenarios. You're welcome to have **strong opinions on this**. Please just remember that this is free stuff, and if you dislike any aspect of it, you are free to only take the parts that you want.
