## FAQ

**Why are there AI-generated images?**  
Mood images and visual aids are AI-generated to convey vibes. They’re non-essential and you're free to ignore them. The concepts and writing are original.

**Is this PG-13?**  
Yes. Most content works for younger audiences or can easily be tweaked, but check notes on each page. Any trigger warnings appear on the relevant character pages.

**How are the characters designed?**
All characters are designed to slot in seamlessly at many tables:

- Level 5
- Built in the official character creator at dndbeyond.com
- All ability scores are taken with the Points buy method.
- Homebrew is marked as such and explained on the character page.
- Characters are built with respect for both narrative weight and game efficiency; they are not "mechanically optimized".
- PDF's are clean sheets taken directly from dndbeyond.com. They do not include all the info on the character page because: 1) it wouldn't fit, 2) it leaves space for the players to take notes.

Take what you want, discard, rebuild or remix the rest.
