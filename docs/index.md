# Steal These Ideas

<img src="assets/sti.png" alt="STI" width="300">

**Steal These Ideas**. I upload conceptually rich and free to use and remix (see readme for license details) content for DMs and players alike. Right now it's mainly D&D stuff, and all I'm asking in return is that you steal these ideas if you like them.

Almost everything is designed to be **plug-and-play** with minimal prep. Characters have been created on the dndbeyond official website (2024 rules). I've had to take liberties to fit all on the official character sheets, but *the builds are all legit*. A few characters have **homebrew suggestions**. These are clearly marked in the documents.

On the **elephant in the room**: Yes, there are some mood images and visual aids that were AI generated. They're not essential to the concepts, which are 100% my own. They're just a way to show the vibes I'm going for. You're welcome to have **strong opinions on this**. Just remember this is free stuff, and you are welcome to only take the parts that you want, remix them and disregard everything else. If people can be civil, hopefully I won't get sad and stop making free stuff for y'all.
