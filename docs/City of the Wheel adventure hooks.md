# Five Philosophical Adventures in the City of the Wheel

The City of the Wheel is not a dungeon to be looted, but a society to be interrogated. Below are five fully developed scenarios designed for roleplay-heavy tables, where dialogue, moral compromise, and political maneuvering carry more weight than sword swings. Each scenario leverages the Water Clock, factional tensions, and the existential dread of the Decanter’s absence to force players into impossible choices—choices that reveal not just what their characters *can* do, but what they *are willing to become*.

## 1. **The Rain Room Gambit**

### Summary
The PCs are hired by a reformist priest-engineer to sabotage the Rain Room during a state ceremony—not to destroy it, but to *expose* its waste. But when the levers jam and the entire city goes dry, they must choose: restore flow to save lives, or let the city suffer to break the Order’s grip.

### Background
High Priest-Engineer Veylan is hosting the “Blessing of the Sands” ceremony, inviting foreign dignitaries to bathe in the Rain Room as a show of divine favor. Meanwhile, Sister Elira, a disillusioned mid-level engineer-priest, believes the spectacle is sacrilege—and a perfect moment to sabotage the diversion mechanism. She hires the PCs to infiltrate the Source Tower’s lower maintenance shafts and jam the Rain Room levers mid-ceremony, forcing the water to flow to the city instead.

### Factions & NPCs
- **Sister Elira (Reformist Priest-Engineer)**: Believes the Order can be redeemed from within. She wants to shame Veylan, not overthrow him. “Let them see the cost of their vanity,” she whispers. But she didn’t plan for the levers to *break*.
- **High Priest Veylan**: Charismatic, ruthless. Uses the Rain Room not for luxury, but as psychological warfare. If the flow stops, he will blame “foreign saboteurs” and execute dissidents.
- **District Overseer Kael (Outer Ring)**: A pragmatist. If water stops flowing, he’ll open his district’s emergency cistern—but only if the PCs help him “disappear” the Order’s guards first.

### Player Choices & Dilemmas
- Do they fix the jammed mechanism to restore water, betraying Elira’s cause?
- Do they let the city dry out for 12–24 hours to maximize political impact, knowing children will die of thirst?
- Do they side with Kael to seize control of a district cistern—becoming de facto warlords in the chaos?
- Do they expose Elira to Veylan to save themselves, condemning her to ritual drowning in the Rain Room?

### Water Clock & Consequences
- **Starts at Day 0** — Sabotage halts *all* flow. City enters emergency state immediately.
- **Day 1**: Riots begin in Outer Ring. Veylan declares martial law.
- **Day 2**: If flow not restored, disease spreads. Kael offers PCs water in exchange for loyalty.
- **Consequence A (Flow Restored)**: Elira is executed. Veylan tightens control. PCs branded traitors by rebels.
- **Consequence B (Flow Denied)**: Outer Ring collapses. Thirstless rise in violent revolt. City enters civil war by Day 4.
- **Consequence C (District Seized)**: PCs become local heroes—or tyrants. The Order will send an army to retake the tower.

## 2. **The Decanter’s Shadow**

### Summary
The PCs recover a *second* Decanter of Endless Water—hidden by one of the original founders. Now, both the Order and the Thirstless demand it. Hand it over, and you empower tyranny or chaos. Keep it, and you become the most hunted beings in the desert.

### Background
An ancient map, etched on sun-bleached bone, leads to a buried shrine in the dunes. There, the PCs find a second Decanter—identical to the one in the Source Tower. The dying founder who hid it whispers: “I knew they’d turn it into a throne. I left this… for the people.” But word leaks. The Order sends assassins. The Thirstless send envoys. Both promise rewards. Both threaten annihilation.

### Factions & NPCs
- **Brother Silas (Thirstless Envoy)**: A former engineer, now rebel. He pleads: “Give us the Decanter. We’ll build a new tower in the Outer Ring. No more masters.” But his faction has no engineers left. They’ll likely break it.
- **Inquisitor Mareth (Order of the Wheel)**: Cold, logical. Offers the PCs noble titles, inner-ring estates, and lifetime water rights. “Chaos is the true enemy. Stability requires hierarchy.” Secretly plans to destroy the second Decanter once acquired.
- **The Grey Market Water Baron**: Offers 50,000 gold pieces and safe passage out of the city—for the Decanter. “Let the fools kill each other. Profit is the only true flow.”

### Player Choices & Dilemmas
- Give it to the Thirstless? You may ignite a revolution—but without technical knowledge, they’ll likely destroy it or get slaughtered trying to install it.
- Give it to the Order? You stabilize the city—but condemn it to another 50 years of theocratic control. Mareth will lie to you.
- Sell it? You profit, but doom the city to its fate—or worse, empower a warlord who uses it to conquer neighboring lands.
- Hide it? You become fugitives. The Water Clock doesn’t start… yet. But the city’s slow decay continues. And someone *will* find it.

### Water Clock & Consequences
- **No immediate countdown** — unless the PCs trigger a crisis (e.g., destroy the original Decanter).
- **But**: The city is already on Day 1 of slow decay due to population growth outpacing infrastructure. Every week without action, subtract 1 day from reserves.
- **If PCs give Decanter to Thirstless**: Water Clock pauses—but after 48 hours, if rebels fail to install it properly, restart at Day 2 with riots.
- **If PCs give it to Order**: Water Clock resets to Day 7—but rationing tightens further. Dissent is crushed. PCs live in gilded cages.
- **If PCs destroy or hide it**: City continues slow collapse. PCs are hunted. The desert remembers.

## 3. **The Thirstless Uprising (And the Well That Wasn’t)**

### Summary
The Thirstless seize Cistern Tower Four—but discover its reserves are poisoned. The PCs, caught in the middle, must broker a truce between rebels and the Order to save thousands… or let them die to prove a point.

### Background
The Thirstless, emboldened by rumors of the PCs’ exploits, launch a coordinated attack on Cistern Tower Four. They win—but find the cistern laced with bitterroot extract (non-lethal but causes vomiting and dehydration). The Order claims it was rebel sabotage. The rebels claim it was a trap. Both are lying. The truth? A low-level clerk poisoned it to create a martyrdom event.

### Factions & NPCs
- **Razek, Thirstless Commander**: Idealistic but out of his depth. “We hold the tower! The people will rally!” But his medics are overwhelmed. He begs the PCs for help purifying the water—or finding a new source.
- **Clerk Nessa (Secret Poisoner)**: Quiet, fanatical. Believes only mass suffering will “awaken” the people. “Let them die thirsty. Then they will rise like dunes in a storm.” She’s prepared to die for her cause.
- **Captain Dain (Desert Police)**: Ordered to retake the tower “at all costs.” But he has family in the district. “I don’t want to burn this place down. Help me find another way.”

### Player Choices & Dilemmas
- Do they help Razek purify the water (requiring rare alchemical components and time), knowing it legitimizes the rebellion?
- Do they negotiate with Captain Dain for a ceasefire and joint investigation—risking being seen as traitors by both sides?
- Do they expose Nessa? She’ll be executed—but her martyrdom may ignite wider revolt.
- Do they let the district suffer, believing the ends justify the means?

### Water Clock & Consequences
- **Starts at Day 3** for District Four only. Citywide clock remains at Day 1.
- **Day 4 (District)**: 20% dead from dehydration. Riots spread to neighboring districts.
- **If PCs broker truce**: District saved. Water Clock pauses. But the Order uses the “rebel poisoning” as propaganda—cracking down citywide.
- **If PCs help purify water**: Thirstless gain legitimacy. Order declares open war. Citywide Water Clock advances to Day 2.
- **If PCs do nothing**: District Four dies. Thirstless movement fractures. Order consolidates power. Water Clock advances to Day 3 citywide.

## 4. **The Voice’s Last Confession**

### Summary
The dying Voice of the Source summons the PCs. He admits the Decanter is failing—and offers them the throne. But accepting means inheriting a lie: the “divine” artifact is a cursed relic, and its magic is draining the life from the land.

### Background
The Voice, Veylan’s predecessor, is bedridden, skin like cracked clay. He reveals the truth: the Decanter isn’t divine. It’s a relic from a drowned empire, powered by a bound water elemental that is slowly dying. Every gallon drawn accelerates the desert’s spread. He ruled knowing this. Now he offers the PCs his seat: “Fix what I could not. Or let it all turn to dust.”

### Factions & NPCs
- **The Dying Voice**: Haunted, remorseful. “We called it a blessing. It was a theft—from the earth itself.” He wants redemption, not survival.
- **High Engineer Veylan (Heir Apparent)**: Doesn’t know the truth. Believes the Decanter is eternal. Will kill to protect the lie. “The people need faith, not facts.”
- **The Bound Elemental (Whispering through pipes)**: Not evil—exhausted. Communicates in dreams and dripping echoes: “Free me… or let me sleep.”

### Player Choices & Dilemmas
- Accept the throne? You must either perpetuate the lie—or reveal the truth and risk total collapse.
- Destroy the Decanter? You doom the city—but free the elemental and halt the desert’s unnatural spread.
- Seek a third way? Perhaps bind a new elemental? Or find a natural aquifer? Both require time the city doesn’t have.
- Side with Veylan? You become the new face of the lie. The elemental’s whispers will haunt you.

### Water Clock & Consequences
- **Starts at Day 5** — The Decanter’s output has already slowed by 40%. The Voice hid it.
- **Day 6**: Elemental’s whispers become audible citywide. Madness spreads.
- **If PCs accept throne and reveal truth**: Mass panic. Water Clock accelerates. +1 Day per 24 hours.
- **If PCs destroy Decanter**: Elemental freed. Desert stops expanding. City dies in 7 days. PCs become legends—or monsters.
- **If PCs bind new elemental**: Requires a sentient sacrifice. Who volunteers? Who is chosen?

## 5. **The Green Belt Ultimatum**

### Summary
The Order offers the PCs a deal: execute the Thirstless leadership, and they’ll divert water to expand the Green Belt—saving thousands from starvation. But the rebels offer the same deal in reverse: help them assassinate the Voice, and they’ll open the cisterns to all. Who do you betray to save more lives?

### Background
The Green Belt—the city’s breadbasket—is failing. Without more water, famine looms in 30 days. The Order can save it… but only if “stability” is ensured (i.e., the Thirstless are crushed). The Thirstless can open the cisterns to feed the poor… but only if the Voice is removed. Both sides offer the PCs wealth, power, and moral absolution. Both are lying about the scale of their promises.

### Factions & NPCs
- **Voice of the Source**: “Kill Razek and his council. I will sign the irrigation decree myself.” But the decree has loopholes—it only waters loyalist farms.
- **Razek (Thirstless)**: “Kill Veylan during the Rain Room ceremony. We’ll flood the Outer Ring with water.” But the Thirstless have no control over the aqueducts—they’ll break them trying.
- **Farmer-Lia (Green Belt Representative)**: Pragmatic. “I don’t care who rules. Just keep the water flowing. Or we all starve.” She’ll betray anyone to save her crops.

### Player Choices & Dilemmas
- Side with the Order? You become executioners. The Green Belt expands—but only for the elite. The Outer Ring starves.
- Side with the Thirstless? You become regicides. The cisterns open—but without engineers, the system floods and breaks. Half the city drowns; half dies of thirst.
- Play both sides? You might buy time—but when discovered, both factions will hunt you.
- Refuse both? The Green Belt dies. Famine hits in 30 days. Water Clock advances 1 day per week of inaction.

### Water Clock & Consequences
- **Starts at Day 1** — But the *Famine Clock* is ticking separately (30 days).
- **If PCs side with Order**: Famine Clock pauses. Water Clock resets to Day 7—but Outer Ring enters permanent drought. Rebellion goes underground.
- **If PCs side with Thirstless**: Famine Clock pauses. Water Clock resets—but after 48 hours, aqueducts rupture. Restart at Day 3 with flooding.
- **If PCs refuse**: Famine Clock reaches Day 30. Mass starvation. Water becomes irrelevant. City collapses into cannibal clans.
