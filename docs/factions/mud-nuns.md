# The Mud Nuns
> *“May your pot never empty, and your purse never swell.”*

## Overview

The **Mud Nuns** — formally *The Sisters of the Undulating Graces* — are a barefoot order of mendicant women who believe divinity resides in all parts of life, including sweat, soot, and labor. They hold that *purity* is a lie of the privileged meant to fatten their pride with illusions. Every act performed with compassion, whether cooking, thieving, or extortion, is holy if it eases suffering, restores balance, and teaches humility.

Wherever there is a gutter, the Mud Nuns are nearby. Their soup lines double as safehouses, their chants are esoteric codes passing information through the streets. They form a decentralized network of mercy and mischief that recognizes no boundary: saints, smugglers, pilferers, and stray dogs are sacred and profane in equal measure.

Their activities blur the line between charity, espionage, spirituality, and organized crime. They maintain trade routes for smuggled identities and safe passage for the persecuted, bribe officials to look away, rob nobles whose feasts could feed a district, and redistribute the spoils among the poor.

## The Three Pillars

The order began with **three women** (Nymwe, Esthara and Gerthel) who refused temple service to the old and influential **Seekers of Penitence** in the City (insert your chosen city’s name here). For daring to claim that holiness could be shared horizontally rather than distributed from above, they were accused of witchcraft, heresy, and blasphemy: *“A hag coven,”* declared the High Synod of the Penitentians.

In defiance, the three broke into the Great Temple and **emptied its cupboard of relics**, selling them to foreign merchants for an immense sum. With the gold, they built kitchens for the poor, shelters for the hunted, and a network of secret safehouses throughout the city.

The Seekers of Penitence swiftly signed contracts for their lives. For years, the three stayed hidden while building their network. Nymwe was finally captured, and later yet, Esthara, both whisked away to be summarily tried and executed in public. Only the third and youngest founder, Gerthel, lived to see the dream of a new Order of Faith come to fruition.

To this day, the Mud Nuns honor the three wise women, calling them the *Three Pillars of Faith*, and live by their creed: *To bow, to give, and to dare* (humility, charity and courage).

## Doctrine and Belief

The Mud Nuns follow three intertwined doctrines collectively known as **The Undulation of the Graces**.

### Doctrine of the Undulation
> *“Divinity cannot be summoned. It comes and goes as it will. We open our souls to receive when it waxes, and strengthen our hearts to endure when it wanes.”*

Few congregations live as rough as the Mud Nuns. Their theology is survival, only one notch more civilized than the city’s cutthroat alleys. In times of plenty, they share the graces, letting divinity flow like a tide of blessings through the lower wards. When times are harsh, they grow... pragmatic.

### Doctrine of Illusion
> *“What fattens the ego, starves the soul.”*

Wealth, nobility, and law are illusions, temporary states mistaken for the deeper truth of the world’s order. A Sister seeks to see through these glamours to glimpse the sacred beneath the grime. They reject all separation between sacred and worldly work. A Sister may bandage a wound, bribe a guard to look the other way as she smuggles out a runaway slave, or slit a tyrant’s purse. Morality or legality are illusions. The only thing that counts is to facilitate the Undulation of Grace.

### Doctrine of Redistribution
> *“Stagnated wealth is poison for the soul.”*

Hoarded wealth, unshared knowledge, or idle strength are seen as forms of spiritual rot. The Undulation demands that coin, power, care and wisdom circulate. To steal from the rich, connect the lonely to the community, or teach the poor to read is not just about morals, it is about unclogging the City's spiritual arteries.

## Organization

The Mud Nuns have **no temple and no central hall**. To gather openly would be suicide, since they are wanted criminals. Instead, they maintain an invisible and highly independent cell network of safehouses known as *Pots*, scattered through the slums, dockyards, and undermarkets of the City.

| Pot Type | Purpose | Typical Locations |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Iron Pots** | Stashes for gear, supplies, and weapons. | Alleys, abandoned stores. |
| **Tin Pots** | Places of learning; turmeric-robed Sisters teach doctrine, literacy, and numeracy. | Hidden schools in poor districts. |
| **Bronze Pots** | Shelters for refugees, escaped slaves, or the abused. | Basements, forgotten shrines. |
| **Copper Pots** | Transit points for escape routes, often tied to thieves’ or smugglers’ guilds. | Docks, tunnels, rural outposts. |

All Pots are funded through “redistribution” operations and black-market sales of liberated goods. Several **local treasuries** exist, but only the Inner Council knows them all. When coffers swell, they invest or redistribute to keep the blessings flowing and their Order lean.

At age forty, a Sister retires from larceny and dons the **turmeric robes**, becoming a teacher, mediator, and spokesperson. Those who reach sixty lay aside the turmeric robes for **white robes**, joining the **Inner Council**, which handles disputes, faith, and long-term strategy.

### Mother Esparda
The reclusive, elderly Aasimar leader of the Mud Nuns. Once luminous, she dimmed her glow through decades among the unwashed. To some she is saint, but to the enemies of the order she is the chief blasphemer. She mostly speaks through her right hand, Sister Demorah.

### Sister Demorah, the Ledger-Hand
A late middle-aged Tiefling, Demorah is pragmatic and unromantic. She's the Sisterhood’s strategist and chief logistics officer. It’s said she never enters a room without ten exits mapped. If Esparda is the heart, Demorah is the pulse.

## Operations and Methods

> *“Bargain with anybody, but choose who you dine with.”*

The Mud Nuns bargain with almost anyone — thieves, nobles, guards, smugglers. All are part of the Undulation. Yet they avoid murder: stopping the flow of life itself is an affront to the Undulation of the Graces. They shun groups who kill for a living, such as assassin guilds and destructive cults.

Methods, aesthetics and to some extent philosophies can vary between Pots (sometimes spawning friendly rivalry for the Inner Council to deal with), but their goal remains: *restore movement to what the powerful have frozen.*

The Order enjoys **immense popularity among the poor and oppressed**. Their support is so immense in the slums that sisters can walk openly in their distinctive turmeric robes without fear of being taken off the street by the law, lest there be riots. Only the Inner Council knows the extent of the contacts and affiliates, but it is vast.

## Symbols and Rituals

> *“Congratulations! Your graces have been successfully redistributed! Kindly receive this as receipt of your contribution to the balance of the cosmos. Best wishes, Sister Ivanova.”*

- **Receipts:** Whenever a Sister steals, she leaves a receipt as proof that this was an act of faith, not of greed.  
- **Street Wildlife:** City animals, whether they be stray dogs, cats, pigeons, raccoons, rats, monkeys, lizards, are all just as much a part of the Undulation as the people. Some Nuns even become *Urban Druids or rangers*, caring for them and training them as helpers or scouts. Some even mark their faces with raccoon stripes of soot to signal their connection with the naked life of the City.
- **The Humbler:** Clerics of the Undulating Graces have summoned this Spiritual Weapon Giant Soup Ladle for generations to keep order in the soup kitchen lines and correct bullies who try to cut in line or take more than their share of the lentil soup. Now it has become less of a weapon, and more of a calling sign for the hungry: Wherever they can see this spectral weapon floating, food and safety is close by.

## The Fork Raids

> *“If the rich can’t stoop to eating with their hands, they shouldn’t eat at all.”*  
> — Anonymous graffiti, Upper Ward

Among the younger Sisters of the Mud Nuns, a forbidden game circulates, called **The Fork Raids**. It has become an entrenched tradition, despite the best efforts of the older nuns to stamp it out. Once each season, the most daring novices conspire to steal every silver, gold, or jeweled fork from the noble districts. To the young Nuns, it’s sacred comedy, and the goal is to humble the wealthy, to force the city’s lords eat with wooden forks, or with their fingers, like everyone else.

Within a week of targeted, intense fork raids, panic ensues — city gossip fills with tales of forks locked in safes, servants being searched at the gates, nobles dining with sharpened sticks or paying mercenaries to guard their cutlery. Locksmiths report record profits; temple feasts are postponed for lack of proper utensils.

Some younger Sisters begin keeping private fork collections, showing them off in secret gatherings like trophies. But fork theft done for vanity, pride, or the thrill of one-upmanship is not sanctified by doctrine. Elder Sisters publicly denounce the raids as “wasteful mockery,” but secretly keep count of how many nobles switch to plain wood.

If discovered, any young Nun who participated in the Fork raid is expected to return every fork, one by one, with an apology, as penance. The journey can take weeks, and it’s said the shame of knocking on gilded doors with stolen forks in hand teaches more theology than a year of sermons.

## The Seekers of Penitence

The Mud Nuns’ heretical origin ensures persecution by nearly every established faith. Their oldest enemies are the **Seekers of Penitence**, an order of ascetics preaching purification through transformation of the ego. They are thematically opposite of the Mud Nuns, but also the order from which the Three Pillars originally came.

The Seekers believe the Mud Nuns are heirs of a Hag Coven who corrupted doctrine, stole relics for dark rituals, and spread chaos to weaken the city’s spiritual defenses.

### The Accords of Ascension
Foundational creeds of the Seekers:

- Regrets are insights in gestation.  
- The mind is the furnace of the soul.  
- Only once your ego is hollow can it serve as a link in the Chain to Heaven.  
- If you fail, the whole chain will break.  
- Guard well your brothers and sisters, for all our sakes.

> *“Seek your heart for regrets, light a fire in your mind, and throw your fears to it like kindling. In the heat of transformation, forge the oath of ascension and add your link to the chain that reaches the heavens.”*  
> — Grand Master Syphone

**Symbol:** Symbolizing both the binding nature of their creeds, and the way every Brother and Sister of their order is dependent on everybody else. Members of the order wear chains in a criss-cross pattern across their torso, above their monk robes, and add more chains as they grow in age and status in the order.  
**Leader:** *Grand Master Syphone*, an ancient, gnarled Elven monk who still remembers the three Pillars and their apostasy. He is laden with chains, criss-crossing his body and forearms.

To the Seekers, the Mud Nuns are not just heretics against order and solidarity, they're the most blatant evidence of what happens when the chain breaks, and *their continued existence is an affront to their whole theology.* 

> *“I don’t care that they feed the poor! They’re utterly weird, and it’s rubbing off on the populace! The last girl we caught wore full raccoon make-up and stabbed Brother Ivar with a bejeweled fork!”*  
> — Serenya, Master of Discipline

#### Temporal Power
- **The Ascension Monastery:** Fortified temple in the Upper Ward.  
- **Chapter Houses** across the city.  
- **Faith Courts:** Legal authority to prosecute “religious crimes.” Most accused Mud Nuns vanish.  
- **The Chain Guard:** 60 warrior-monks with arrest powers.

#### Economic Power
- Tithes from wealthy patrons.  
- Workshops producing textiles, metalwork, illuminated texts.  
- Training contracts with city guards.

#### Political Power
- Seats on the City Council.  
- Grand Master Syphone advises the Duke on “spiritual matters.”  
- Many judges and magistrates are former Seekers.

### Gender and the Order
While written as a women’s order, any player may join regardless of gender identity. The Order is written as a classic women's Order, but if a player wishes to join it as a male or non-binary PC, the philosophy of this author is to allow gender to be present and visible, but never be an obstacle for the wishes and ideas of the table.

## Hooks and Play Opportunities

??? **Plot hooks for DM's**
    - All factions come to life when there's real, internal conflict. What happens when Demorah, the pragmatic one, needs to sacrifice a Bronze Pot full of refugees to protect the entire network, and Esparda, the Aasimar saint, says "absolutely not"? What happens when Demorah’s cold pragmatism butts up against the order’s core tenets of mercy?
    - Use the order as a network of safehouses or black-market healers when on the run.  
    - The party finds conflicting receipts. Is there a rogue Sister, or a copycat?
    - Lately, a slew of crackdowns have decimated the Mud Nuns and they've been all but driven off from several districts in the City. The Seekers of Penitence seem to have insider knowledge of many of their safehouses. Older Sisters avoid donning their turmeric robes for fear or recognition. Meanwhile the senior Sister Nadya has gone missing... Did she defect or have the Seekers found a way to make her speak?
    - Have the Mud Nuns appear as unlikely allies in an urban heist or revolution arc.  
    - When the PCs anger the wrong people, the Order may offer a way out... at a cost.

## Cultural Context and Inspirations

Most D&D faiths draw from Western theology, but the Mud Nuns draw a lot of inspiration from **Hindu philosophy** (and also to some extent South American and Palestinian Liberation Theology), aiming to honor underrepresented spiritual systems. But they are entirely fictional and not meant to closely represent any real-world faith or practice.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Satyagraha (Force of Truth):** Civil disobedience as active redistribution.  
- **Bhakti (Way of the Heart):** Devotion over religious and social hierarchy, or ritual purity.  
- **Maya (Illusion):** Clinging to wealth is to be trapped in illusion by your attachments.  
- **Seva (Selfless Service):** Theft and redistribution is sacred duty in service of both the rich who are liberated and the poor who receive relief.

Players and DMs are encouraged to research these traditions with respect, avoiding reductive or exoticized portrayals. The anglicized terms are provided as alternatives for tables preferring to avoid potential appropriation.
