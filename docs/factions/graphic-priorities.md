Here’s a structured **priority list for the Mud Nuns graphics pipeline**, derived from the JSON and lore document you uploaded. It orders visual assets by *narrative necessity, reuse value,* and *production efficiency*.

## 🎯 Tier 1 — Core Identity (Immediate Priority)

> Defines faction recognition, usable across all media (book, poster, GitHub repo, TTRPG handouts).

   * **Concept:** Three overlapping bowls forming an infinity knot; steam rising.
   * **Use cases:** Branding, corner sigil, watermark, print header.
   * **Formats:** Vector (.svg) + hi-res raster (.png).
   * **Variants:** Full color / black & white / turmeric monotone.

2. **The Humbler (Spectral Ladle)**

   * **Purpose:** Signature relic and light source; appears in lore and gameplay.
   * **Variants:** Floating idle / serving / “correction” gesture.
   * **Lighting guide:** Emits soft golden light; use as global illumination reference for other assets.

3. **Receipt Template**

   * **Purpose:** Printable prop and in-world motif.
   * **Design:** Torn parchment texture, Mud Nun handwriting font, ladle stamp.
   * **Uses:** Handout, quest item, sidebar graphic, promo asset.

## ❄️ Tier 5 — Deluxe & Atmospheric Expansion (Optional / Later)

> Useful for campaigns, posters, and lore compendiums after the visual language is locked.

11. **Fork Raid Poster or Zine Art**

* **Medium:** Screenprint-style, limited palette.

12. **Contrast Faction Illustration**

* **Seekers of Penitence:** Cool palette, vertical composition, clean chains.
* **Purpose:** Juxtapose with Mud Nuns for visual storytelling.
