## The Blackwell Legacy 

Among the dwarves of the Blackwell Clan, a warrior's shield is a vessel of memory, duty, and spirit. When a Blackwell warrior falls, their comrades are bound by sacred duty to retrieve their shield, even if the body is lost. A fragment of the fallen’s soul is believed to cling to the shield, and to leave it behind is to leave the dead untethered. 

If the shield is destroyed beyond repair, what remains is reforged into a Griefshield, a replacement acknowledged, but never quite the same. Griefshields are hung with solemn reverence and never placed above a cradle. 

Upon return, the shield is placed in the Sanctum Alcove for a full year of mourning. Shieldsmiths, part artisan and part priest, tend to it with oil, prayer, and memory carvings. During this time, the family offers libations, stories, and burn memory scrolls to prepare the spirit for its next bearer. 

When the year has passed, the shield is reborn into service. The clerics, with guidance from augury and the shieldsmith, assign it to a newborn whose cradle is crowned with the shield. From that moment, it will be with them until death. A Blackwell shield is thus witness to the full arc of a life, from the nursery to the battlefield.

Each shield bears the engraved names of its previous bearers, some faded, others freshly scored, forming a line of remembrance carried into every battle. The shields hang in rows within the clan’s meadhall between lifetimes, each waiting for a match, each a library of stories etched in steel and splinters. 

*“You do not carry the shield. The shield carries you, and you carry your clan.”*
