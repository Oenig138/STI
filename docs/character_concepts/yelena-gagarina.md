A halfling refugee who escaped a grotesque gnomish blood-sport, Yelena lost her arm, her innocence, and her patience for cruelty. Armed with a prosthetic limb, her master‚Äôs wooden medallion, and an unyielding sense of principle, she wanders the roads as both protector and fugitive, always one step ahead of her pursuers.

## Personality

* Fatalistic, dry humor; deeply principled, but understated. 
* Can‚Äôt stand to see strays or the wounded suffer, even though she doesn‚Äôt think of herself as an ‚Äúanimal person.‚Äù  
* Skeptical of nobility and power. Trust comes hard, but once given, she protects it fiercely.  
* Carries the contradiction of being both a thief and an earnest, moral presence.  
* Most likely party member to give blunt advice that makes a child cry, then hug them anyway.

## Gameplay Notes

??? info "Playing Yelena effectively"
	- **Voice & Vibe**: Quiet, watchful, with precise remarks. Play her as someone who doesn‚Äôt waste words, but whose honesty carries weight. She's already made tremendous sacrifices for what she believes in, but she's not in the habit of flaunting her woes to the world. She's a good choice if you prefer a quieter character at the table.
	- **Flavor and respect**: Her prosthetic arm and tinkering skill are story hooks. Mention upkeep, adjustments, or creative uses in play. Please consider the dynamics of playing a person with amputations at the table, with regards to a respectful representation. As a halfling monk with missing limbs she may raise a few eyebrows. Decide how you want her to handle this at the table.
	- **Table presence**: She‚Äôs not a spotlight hog, but when she speaks, it should land. Think of her as the party‚Äôs quiet conscience, and sometimes, quiet fist.
	- **Yelena's macguffin**: Yelena always has the opportunity to return the stolen Astral crystal. Every day she chooses not to is another day she chooses to be hunted down by the gnomish network. Consider how this weighs on Yelena as a character. Even though she's tough as nails, she may start becoming flat if you never show her faltering.

??? danger "DM Guidance"
	- **The Blood-Sport Past**: The gnomish network and its scrying games are rich antagonists. Use them for recurring threats or intrigue.  
	- **The Artifact**: Yelena knows the secret location of the stolen Astral crystal that collapsed the broadcast. This can anchor a whole campaign arc.
	- **Mentor & Prot√©g√©**: Lidda Willowkin or Seraphina de Spanta can recur as allies, foils, or romantic entanglements. Play them to draw out Yelena‚Äôs guarded heart, but remember to seek player consent before adding romantic interests.
