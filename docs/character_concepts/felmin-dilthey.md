A scholar touched by cosmic horror, Felmin is a stargazer who no longer dares to look at the sky. Ever since one dreadful night in the observatory, heâ€™s become a reluctant conduit for strange powersâ€”friendly, polite, and deeply uneasy about the eyes of the world. He may be the partyâ€™s comic relief, but make no mistake: something ancient peers through him.

## Personality

* Cheerful, scholarly, and sincerely curiousâ€”but visibly on edge outdoors.
* Hides under a broad-rimmed hat; not ashamed of his star-touched eye, just tired of questions.
* Avoids open skies; prefers glasshouses, bestiaries, controlled environments.
* Hands always busy: lens polishing, clockwork tinkering, sketching.
* Has an endearing habit of muttering Attenborough-style nature narrationâ€”even while observing grim phenomena.
* Most likely character in the party to be mistaken for a peeping tom.

## Backstory (Short Form)

Felmin grew up in the high mountains, child of naturalists who maintained an ancient observatory. One night, he pointed the telescope toward a blank patch of sky... and something looked back. He was found raving, his pupil a white glimmering star. Since then, he has refused to look at the heavens, fled his mountain home, and taken to grinding lenses and reading starmaps indoors. He still loves people, still writes his parents, and still believes in beauty, but he knows too much to ever feel safe under the open sky again.

## Gameplay Notes

??? info "Playing Felmin effectively"
	- Lean into the contradiction: a druid who loves nature from a distance. Play him like an indoor biologist or optical savant.
	- Use the Cloak of Elvenkind and his stealth skills to show his compulsion to vanish when overwhelmed.
	- Channel a polite, professorial tone with nervous jokes and scattered focus. Think: David Attenborough meets anxious gnome.
	- Starry Form is both his biggest power spike and his worst fear: when he glows, the stars see him back.
	- His owl familiar shares the same glowing eye; roleplay it as an unsettling yet useful companion.

??? danger "DM Guidance"
	- Felmin works best when treated as a **magnet for fate**. Have NPCs stumble across him, plot items cling to him, omens follow him. This doesnâ€™t have to be heavy-handedâ€”just consistent.
	- His **spyglass** is a narrative trigger. You can seed flashes of insight, visions, or false images when he peers through it. Especially potent if he ever points it toward the sky again.
	- The **cursed star** he glimpsed may reappear annually. It could be a lich's phylactery, a divine prison, or a sentient stellar entity. Let it reflect your campaign's central theme (pride, fate, knowledge).
	- Consider escalating his familiar's behavior over time. The owl might act without commands or witness things Felmin refuses to see.
