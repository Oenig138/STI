##Sergeant Bink
*Your local cryptid with badge authority*

Bink is a lv 8 **Bugbear Fighter Rune Knight** who overthinks everything, is possessed with patterns, and works as a sheriff with a penchant for "red yarn and corkboard style" crime-fighting. Despite his line of work, he retains much of the quiet menace of his species. This is more of "Captain Vimes meets True Detective meets Twin Peaks", but the sheriff is the local bouncer who accidentally got promoted to a public office and now does it conscientiously, even admirably... but with his very own, unsettling fey-goblinoid flavor of competence.

##Mechanics, gear and flavor
**Frost Rune** gives advantage on Intimidation checks ("I'm not angry, I'm disappointed. And also I'm 7 feet tall and the literal creature your nan told you ghost stories about, so I'm going to ask again..."). Perfect for a sheriff trying to press an informant, also, very Bugbear. A way to get at least competent in a CHA skill without having to sink too many points into a suboptimal ability stat for a Fighter.

**Stone Rune** gives advantage on Insight checks. For when you need to intuit motives and secrets. Too bad he can't Insight check himself. It also serves this image of a sheriff with poor reasoning but solid instincts. He can *feel* when something's off, even though he doesn't quite grasp the details.
 
It also provides a fey-flavored "non-lethal takedown" via **Charming** your quarry instead of subduing them. "Okay buddy, you're done for tonight. Time to sleep it off, champ."
 
**Fire rune** does some extra damage + summons literal shackles that Restrain opponents on a failed STR save. "So are we done yet, or do you want another walloping?"

He comes with a small but flavorful gadget-belt of magic items that are geared to be appropriate to his level. His own brand of Batman gadgets if you will, although he's more into throwing hatchets than batarangs.

The **Mithral Splint armour** gives no additional AC bonus, but allows him to get sneaky. This harmonizes with his **Slippers of Spider Climbing** that he uses to patrol rooftops at night, or hang off the ceiling like a Batman from Wish, sneaking on baddies dealing with contraband in the alleyways, mumbling to himself that his theories are never wrong (they're almost always wrong). It is when he leans the most into his Bugbear heritage.
 
**Sentinel Shield** gives advantage to Perception checks and Initiative rolls. This isn't just flavor; together with his Guard background giving him the Alert feat (add proficiency bonus to Initiative roll) he will be pretty much guaranteed to always go early, which is great for a Bugbear who gets big bonus damage on the first round.

Bink does not go Great Weapon Master or Polearm Master/Sentinel fot those big hits at extra range. Instead he leans into **Grappling**. (*"I don't want any trouble, but keep stirring it and I *will* tackle you into a rain barrel"*) He has **Long Reach** and he uses it to restrain opponents. With **Giant's Might** he can also grapple Huge creatures while making it difficult for them to grapple him back. **Unarmed Fighting** gives him an important means of dealing damage while grappling. When he's not doing that, he's controlling the battlefield with shield and 1-handed weapon, using **Sentinel** as a way to say "nuh-uh, you stay put till I say otherwise", and Weapon Masteries to Topple threats or Push them around. ("You, over there, now!", "Stay down, and consider your past ten decisions critically.")

**Early action** is a necessity for this build, as he's mostly built for sturdiness and control, not nova damage. His first round should ideally be impactful: Close the distance to the nearest threat, Surprise Attack plus Fire Rune Shackles for +4d6 bonus damage (provided you hit and they fail the save DC), doff your weapon and make an Unarmed strike to Grapple (if they have the Restrained condition, you roll to hit at Advantage, if they use DEX to save vs Grapple, they do so at Disadvantage), adding another +2d6 in Surprise Attack damage, and ideally making your target both Grappled and Restrained. Use any remaining movement to carry your target wherever you want. If the enemy remains Grappled after they finish their next turn, and thus within 30 ft, you can use a Reaction to activate Stone Rune and possibly have them Charmed, while grappled. This could allow you to on your turn either carry them wherever you want without further struggle, or disengage and go for other targets.

When grappling isn’t the right answer, Bink shifts gears with uncanny competence. Spearing several different enemies instead of focusing attacks imposes Sap and disadvantages on more attacks next round, making the fight safer for everyone. That's the responsible lawman's move. He manages threats and subdues them: The Warhammer's Push effect with Sentinel means an enemy triggering an Attack of Opportunity is Pushed 10 ft away, potentially out of reach to make attacks. With their movement reduced to zero, they've wasted their turn. Bink may not be smart, but he has solid instincts and doesn't have to be played sub-optimally in combat.
 
He also has proficiency in these exact skills, rounding out his Sheriff kit: **Intimidation, Perception, Insight and Sneak.**

Bink feel his way through clues. Insight checks to read people, Perception to notice details, but he absolutely mangles any Investigation check that requires logical deduction. Other PCs might feel the need to gently steer him away from his wildest theories while letting him follow his gut.

## Backstory
How a bugbear even got into law enforcement to begin with. His predecessor Rowan was also his secret mentor and foster-mother,a popular sheriff in town. She was a ranger who found Bink as a cub, abandoned by his goblin tribe for being a bit too weird. The town wasn't too eager to receive a Bugbear cub, but Rowan's name held weight, so he was tolerated. Growing up, he spent more and more time as a deputy of sorts, providing the aging ranger with well-needed muscle enforcement. But despite growing up in the job, Bink never showed the aptitude for thinking like a real sheriff. It didn't worry him much. Rowan was going to live forever, right? 

To this day, he is still haunted by his failure to catch that one criminal, that one time. The one who got away after killing Rowan on a fateful night, turning his life upside down. The next day when he showed up in the townsquare among the mourning, wearing Rowan's badge and a deadpan look, the townspeople were scared and apprehensive. The first few months were rough, but through hard labor and dedication, he eventually earned their trust.

##Bink in 10 points
 
	- Talks to his corkboard like it’s a coworker.
	- His WIS/Insight lets him feel when something's off, but his INT 8 means he can't explain it, so he fills the gap with elaborate nonsense theories that happen to point in vaguely the right direction. He's learned policing as apprenticeship/imitation rather than intellectual framework. "This is what my predecessor did, so I do it too, even if I don't fully understand why."
	- Scribbles and carves hypnotic patterns on every single piece of his gear.
	- Loves his town with that gruff, clumsy tenderness of someone who doesn’t know how to express it other than through body tackles and endless shifts of late night stalking. And they sort of love him back, but are also a little uneasy at his intensity.
	- Is never right on the first try, but always right on the third.
	- Has a sprawling theory about a major underworld syndicate he calls "the Web" and will occasionally bring it up mid-grapple if he even suspects the grapplee might know something, *anything*.
	- Takes his job seriously, even if he seems goofy and creepy. Hasn't slept a full night in years and is going prematurely bald.
	- Is so bad at the paperwork part of the job that he occasionally eats the report (with tears in his eyes) and later claims it was misplaced. He feels major shame about this, his dirty secret.
	- The townspeople do appreciate him, because he catches the smugglers, scares the teen troublemakers straight and rescues every lost cat. They also bake him pies because he regularly forgets to eat. But they don't ask him to explain his theories anymore. For some reason the children love him.
	- The "seeing patterns thing" is a Fey thing. They don't think like us. They see patterns where others don't. But not all patterns are relevant. The number of dogs in the city square may line up in a fibonacci sequence with the number of towels on the clothes line, but that's only relevant if your understanding of the world leans "magic realism". 
 
## For the DM only

??? danger "Plot arc suggestion"
	That one criminal was in fact the leader of the Web, which Rowan had secretly been tracking for some time. Now, to Bink he is the ghost that got away, and the perfect tragedy for a character who sees too much and understands too little. Bink felt the pattern, but he couldn't articulate it in a way that made the world take him seriously. Now, every conspiracy theory is haunted by that failure. The Web is the only pattern he's ever seen clearly. But nobody believes him, so he doubles down, gets more intense, more obsessive. The corkboard grows and the theories get wilder. Somewhere in that tangle of red string is the actual shape of the thing, if only someone could parse Fey logic through a mortal filter.
	
	Bink's story begs for a DM to make The Web real, but more importantly, real in exactly the way Bink imagines it, down to details so obscure and esoteric it took a Fey mind to even start sniffing them out: they did in fact use the dogs in the town square to send secret messages to the undercover washer women! The baker's sourdough starter WAS a deaddrop system based on fermentation timing that only makes sense if you think in lunar cycles and sympathetic magic. The Web is small-town mystery, Fantasy Twin Peaks by ways of brawling goblinoids. You can flavor the Bink arc of the party's adventures as a weird, misty noir detective story where nothing, including the owls, is what it seems.
	
	The vindication likely won't feel good, but horrifying. Bink has been right this whole time, and everyone (including himself, in his worst moments) thought he was losing his mind. He was just trying his best to operate with a mortal brain wired to Feywild frequencies.
	
	Even so, at the end of Bink's arc, he hopefully gets to surpass his master and avenge her, proving that he did in fact have the aptitude for this work, he was just a late (and weird) bloomer.
