Mocked half a lifetime by his Orc clan *Iron Tusk* for being ‚Äúsoft gutted,‚Äù Geldok finally fled his life of raiding after defending innocents in a caravan massacre. In the night, a forgotten shrine called out to him, where divine fire seared patterns into his arms. For lack of theological subtlety, he named the power the **Big Boss**, and devoted his life to healing and justice. Geldok is a tent-clinic cleric of a streetcorner religion: part battlefield medic, part community problem solver, with no patience for titles or hierarchies.

## Gameplay Notes

??? info "Playing Geldok Iron Tusk effectively"
	- Geldok‚Äôs not a drip-feed healer but a problem solver with no time for titles.
	- Do a vibe check with the table before leaning too far into Orc dialect shenanigans.
	- Geldok's **Tough feat + Life Domain** scaling means he can frontline without folding. Don‚Äôt be afraid to wade into melee with mace and shield.
	- Lean into the ‚Äútent healer‚Äù downtime role: free clinics, honey treats for kids, calling out abusers. This builds bonds and makes him more than a healbot.

??? danger "DM Guidance"
	- **The Big Boss** can be tailored to your table‚Äôs tone and campaign setting. They can be a member of the existant pantheon under another name, or something else, whether comic (no-nonsense union rep deity), tragic (broken god of mercy), or radical (breaker of chains). Discuss with your player!
	- Geldok‚Äôs justice streak can pull him into NPC side quests. Make sure these enhance the party‚Äôs main arc and that all are onboard so it doesn't feel like derailing.
	- His old clan, the Iron Tusks, and rivals like **Kigra** are excellent recurring threats. Don‚Äôt resolve them too quickly! They give Geldok‚Äôs story teeth.
