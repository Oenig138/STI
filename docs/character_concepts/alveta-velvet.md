Velvet grew up sparring with sticks in the woods with her childhood friend Reed, dreaming up the ‚ÄúTwo Winds One Will‚Äù style. Their scam dojo days are behind her ‚Äî now she duels with real blades, half showmanship, half stubborn faith that a child‚Äôs dream can become legend. Her Oath of Glory is not faith in gods, but in the idea that a mocked dream can inspire greatness.

## Gameplay Notes

??? info "Playing Velvet effectively"
	- Her **combat style is choreography**: Scimitar (Nick), Shortsword (Vex), and a follow-up strike ‚Äî with smites layered in when needed.
	- She‚Äôs at her best when dueling: narrate flourishes, witty puns, and dramatic reversals. Switch to rapier + shield if defense is needed.
	- **Peerless Athlete** and Air Genasi speed make her highly mobile. Use soaring leaps and stylish maneuvers to keep the flair alive.
	- Remember: Velvet‚Äôs oath isn‚Äôt just about victory, but **inspiring others** to believe in their own dreams.

??? danger "DM Guidance"
	- Velvet is flamboyant. Ensure the table is comfortable with her high-energy tone before she joins.
	- Reed is her strongest hook: play him as rival, foil, and eventual tragedy, but don‚Äôt let him steal her spotlight.
	- Garrick Pike makes an excellent long-term rival/mentor NPC. His presence reinforces Velvet‚Äôs growth without overshadowing her arc.
