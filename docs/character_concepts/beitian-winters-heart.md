* Prodigy Dragonchess player, and will always seek out the local playing spots to socialize, listen to gossip and win some coin off the local champions

## Gameplay Notes

??? info "Playing Betty effectively"
	- **Lean into psionics + roguish flair**: Betty‚Äôs Psychic Blades let her fight without weapons drawn, perfect for a hustler who ‚Äújust happens‚Äù to be dangerous.  
	- **Skill monkey**: With expertise, Observant lip-reading, and Eyes of the Eagle, she can gather intel in ways few PCs can. Use this to create memorable scenes of clever surveillance or sudden insight.  
	- **Deafness at the table**: Play Beitian's deafness with purpose, avoid spectacle. Feel free to read the guidance section in the character sheet PDF.
	- **Table banter**: Betty shines in social play. Use her sardonic humor, gambling habits, and pranks to keep RP lively and unpredictable. Think of her as the party‚Äôs chaos element‚Äîbut always with a heart for her friends.  

??? danger "DM Guidance"
	- **Gambling addiction**: Build tension by tempting her with wagers and schemes. A ‚Äúcan‚Äôt-miss opportunity‚Äù can become a narrative hook or moral trap.  
	- **Clan ties**: Betty‚Äôs clan debt and shame offer long-term story fuel. Encounters with dragonborn messengers, gamblers, or even her old rival Desdemond Swigg can drive arcs of pride, growth, or reconciliation.  
	- **Deafness at the table**: Keep it flavorful, not punitive. Highlight moments where visual cues or psychic whispers matter, and occasionally let a missed cue spark drama without sidelining her.  
	- **Flight + eagle eyes**: Treat her long-range lip-reading as a cinematic flourish rather than an ‚Äúauto-succeed‚Äù button. Use distance, lighting, and obstacles to keep it balanced while rewarding creativity.
