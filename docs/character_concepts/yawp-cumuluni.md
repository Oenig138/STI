## Gameplay Notes

??? info "Playing Yawp Cumuluni effectively"
    - **Be the storm, not the spotlight hog**: Yawp is loud, loving, and larger-than-life, but her role is to lift the party. Play her as a hype-woman who makes allies shine instead of drowning them out. Not the diva, but the teamplayer.
    - **Frontline bard energy**: With Combat Inspiration, medium armor, shield, and a +1 flail, you‚Äôre built to wade into melee. Mix thunderous spells (*Shatter*, *Heat Metal*) with Bardic Inspiration to keep fights cinematic and noisy.
    - **Joyful resilience**: Treat every teleport (Cloud‚Äôs Jaunt) or climb (Slippers of Spider Climbing) as a chance for Yawp to crash through boundaries, physical or social. Why shrink back when you can double down?
	- **No such thing as retreat**: Try to frame fleeing from combat as "charging, but in a new and more fun direction".

??? danger "DM Guidance"
    - **Test her freedom**: Yawp‚Äôs greatest fear is restraint, whether physical or institutional. Scenes that try to cage or silence her give players a chance to showcase her defiance.
    - **Make the echoes matter**: Her dream of shouting from the highest peak is metaphor as much as quest hook. Let natural wonders, storms, or divine omens answer her voice in unexpected ways.
    - **Handle volume with care**: In party dynamics, Yawp might overwhelm quieter PCs. Create outlets (concerts, rituals, public challenges) where her noise is celebrated, and leave quieter spaces where others can breathe.
