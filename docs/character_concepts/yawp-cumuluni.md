## Personality

* Extremely loud, magnanimous and fun-loving. Not the sly, smart bard, more the reveler who has a whole lifetime of mischief to catch up on.
* Social super-connector and proactive Creator of Situations, sometimes spins tall tales for shits and giggles instead of just saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù.
* Yearns to make a noise loud enough to be echoed by the sky itself. Fears being caged again, and will not willingly enter small spaces.
* Most likely party member to accidentally enter a dance-off and get disqualified for breaking the stage.

## Gameplay Notes

??? info "Playing Yawp Cumuluni effectively"
    - **Be the storm, not the spotlight hog**: Yawp is loud, loving, and larger-than-life, but her role is to be a hype-woman who makes allies shine. Like a good frontwoman vocalist, she's not a diva. She knows the show would be moot without the whole band.
    - **Frontline bard energy**: With Combat Inspiration, medium armor and shield, you‚Äôre built to function decently well in melee. Mix thunderous spells (*Shatter*, *Heat Metal*) with Bardic Inspiration to keep fights cinematic and noisy.
    - **Joyful resilience**: Treat every teleport (Cloud‚Äôs Jaunt) or climb (Slippers of Spider Climbing at DM's discretion) as a chance for Yawp to crash through boundaries, physical or social. Why shrink back when you can double down? Have her teleport into the roof and fight upside down, playing the bagpipes. Yawp is all about movement and freedom.
	- **No such thing as retreat**: Try to frame fleeing from combat as "charging, but in a new and more fun direction". 

??? danger "DM Guidance"
    - **Test her freedom**: Yawp‚Äôs greatest fear is restraint, whether physical or institutional. Scenes that try to cage or silence her give players a chance to showcase her vulnerable sides, but also play out defiance and overcoming fears.
    - **Make the echoes matter**: Her dream of shouting from the highest peak of the world is metaphor as much as quest hook. Let natural wonders, storms, or divine omens answer her voice in unexpected ways.
    - **Handle volume with care**: In party dynamics, Yawp might overwhelm quieter PCs. Create outlets (concerts, rituals, public challenges) where her noise is celebrated, and leave quieter spaces where others can breathe.
