Aramis Rosarian wanders from town to town posing as a priest of the obscure **Fellowship of the Radiant Solstice**. But beneath the borrowed vestments and sun‑motif rosary lies a man whose aberrant powers once unmasked corruption in his order, and cost him everything. To this day he curses his naive belief in the righteousness of the world and of the faith, having tasted their "justice" first-hand. Even so, he poses as a man of the cloth and offers comfort and token healings, but his magic is subtle, defensive, and born of something disturbing and alien.

## Personality

* Distrustful; he has scryed too many dark thoughts to believe in virtue.
* Helps the vulnerable, but only on his own guarded terms.
* Keeps his true sorcerous nature hidden behind clerical platitudes of piety.
* Secretly longs for a quiet life, a vineyard, and unconditional acceptance.
* The most likely party member to inadvertently get pulled into a theological rap battle and win by the skin of his teeth.

## Gameplay Notes

??? info "Playing Aramis effectively"
	- **Not a real healer**: Don’t rely on him for restorative magic.
	- **Leverage deception**: Use *Disguise Self*, *Subtle Spell*, and *Telepathic Speech* to steer scenes.
	- **Plan the reveal**: Coordinate with the DM for a dramatic unmasking of his false cleric identity.

??? danger "DM Guidance"
	- Make sure Aramis’s deception enriches party cohesion and doesn't derail it.
	- Introduce witch‑hunters, suspicious clergy, or villagers who notice inconsistencies.
	- Offer opportunities for growth: exposure, possibilities to use the aberrant abilities for good (or bad), or moral conflict that forces action.

## Backstory (Short Form)

Fifteen years ago, novice Aramis discovered the abbot of his abbey embezzling alms. While his aberrant telepathy exposed the crime, he also outed himself. Branded a heretic, he fled and forged the clerical persona he still maintains. Each new town offers fresh coin and momentary refuge, but every night he drowns his guilt in wine and anonymity.

* A dying child whose cure forces him to choose between secrecy and compassion
* An old friend who recognizes him beneath the cowl

## Playing Aramis Rosarian

**Public Face**: Aramis presents himself as a pious, itinerant cleric — a man of the cloth, humble but world-weary. His speech in public is deliberate, measured, and salted with well-rehearsed platitudes about faith, duty, and the gods’ inscrutable will. His vestments are worn but not ragged; his rosaries are functional but poorly kept, the beads dulled from neglect. His eyes carry a haunted, wary look that never fully lifts.

**Private Truth**: In reality, Aramis is an Aberrant Mind sorcerer whose divine image is a cover. His true arcane focus is hidden in a secret pocket in his robes; any perceptive observer might spot him touching it in the wrong context. His “divine magic” is psionic manipulation — and his faith is, at best, a performance.

---

### At the Table
- **Opening Gambit**: When first meeting NPCs or the party, slip into the “pious cleric” speech pattern — formal, slow, and with light sermonizing.  
- **Cracks in the Mask**: Occasionally fumble the persona — use a spell in a way a cleric normally wouldn’t, refer to arcane theory, or respond too quickly to something esoteric.  
- **Spotlight Seeds**: Above the table, give players breadcrumbs — e.g., narrate a night where Aramis disappears, transforms his appearance, and spends hours on a solitary bender. This tips them off OOC that something’s off, while leaving their PCs in the dark.  
- **Suspense Management**: Don’t overuse the deception. Let moments of genuine connection or moral conflict breathe so Aramis feels like a person, not just a twist.

---

### Hooks for the DM
- **Suspicion Rolls**: Let the DM call for Perception or Insight checks from allies/NPCs at opportune moments (e.g., a flash of the hidden focus, an arcane slip).  
- **Faction Pressure**: Have agents from his past appear — either allies who know the truth or enemies who can expose him.  
- **Faith as Theater**: Challenge him with situations where he must act as a cleric in a way his magic can’t fully support, forcing improvisation.

---

**Key Dynamic**: Aramis is most fun when both the *players* and *PCs* are working from incomplete but different sets of information. The trick is to keep the tension simmering — enough to intrigue, but not so much that it becomes an OOC frustration.
