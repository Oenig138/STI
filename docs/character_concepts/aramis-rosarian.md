Aramis Rosarian wanders from town to town posing as a priest of the obscure **Fellowship of the Radiant Solstice**. But beneath the borrowed vestments and sun‑motif rosary lies a man whose aberrant powers once unmasked corruption in his order, and cost him everything. To this day he curses his naive belief in the righteousness of the world and of the faith, having tasted their "justice" first-hand. Even so, he poses as a man of the cloth and offers comfort and token healings, but his magic is subtle, defensive, and born of something disturbing and alien.

## Personality

* Distrustful; he has scryed too many dark thoughts to believe in virtue.
* Helps the vulnerable, but only on his own guarded terms.
* Keeps his true sorcerous nature hidden behind clerical platitudes of piety.
* Secretly longs for a quiet life, a vineyard, and unconditional acceptance.
* The most likely party member to inadvertently get pulled into a theological rap battle and win by the skin of his teeth.

## Backstory (Short Form)

Fifteen years ago, novice Aramis' aberrant powers awakened. Inadvertently reading the mind of the clergy, he discovered the abbot of his abbey embezzling alms. While his aberrant telepathy exposed the crime, he also outed himself. Branded a heretic, he fled. Still anxious about settling down anywhere, he has forged a clerical persona that he still maintains. Each new town offers fresh coin and momentary refuge, but every night he drowns his guilt in wine at the cheapest taverns, after using a spell to disguise his appearance.

## Gameplay Notes

??? info "Playing Aramis effectively"
	- **Not a real healer**: Don’t rely on him for restorative magic.
	- **Plan the reveal**: Coordinate with the DM for a dramatic unmasking of his false cleric identity.
	- **Opening Gambit**: When first meeting NPCs or the party, slip into the “pious cleric” speech pattern — formal, slow, and with light sermonizing  
	- **Cracks in the Mask**: Occasionally fumble the persona — use a spell in a way a cleric normally wouldn’t, refer to arcane theory, or respond too quickly to something esoteric.  
	- **Spotlight Seeds**: Above the table, give players breadcrumbs — e.g., narrate a night where Aramis disappears, transforms his appearance, and spends hours on a solitary bender. This tips them off OOC that something’s off, while leaving their PCs in the dark.  
	- **Suspense Management**: Don’t overuse the deception. Let moments of genuine connection or moral conflict breathe so Aramis feels like a person, not just a twist.

??? danger "DM Guidance"
	- Aramis appears to be a cleric, but is not. If the player chooses to keep the party in the dark too, help them coordinate a reveal moment that’s meaningful but not disruptive.
	- Don’t rely on him for healing roles. His magic is subtle, manipulative, and defensive, not restorative. Ensure the group won’t suffer when the illusion drops.
	- Offer opportunities for growth: exposure, possibilities to use the aberrant abilities for good (or bad), or moral conflict that forces action.
	- Call for Perception or Insight checks from allies/NPCs at opportune moments (e.g., a flash of the hidden focus, an arcane slip).  
	- Have agents from his past appear — either allies who know the truth or enemies who can expose him.  
	- Challenge him with situations where he must act as a cleric in a way his magic can’t fully support, forcing improvisation.
