Aramis Rosarian wanders from town to town posing as a priest of the obscure **Fellowship of the Radiant Solstice**. But beneath the borrowed vestments and sunâ€‘motif rosary lies a man whose aberrant powers once unmasked corruption in his order, and cost him everything. To this day he curses his naive belief in the righteousness of the world and of the faith, having tasted their "justice" first-hand. Even so, he poses as a man of the cloth and offers comfort and token healings, but his magic is subtle, defensive, and born of something disturbing and alien.

* Keeps his true sorcerous nature hidden behind clerical platitudes of piety.
* Secretly longs for a quiet life, a vineyard, and unconditional acceptance.

## Gameplay Notes

??? info "Playing Aramis effectively"
\- **Not a real healer**: Donâ€™t rely on him for restorative magic.
\- **Leverage deception**: Use *Disguiseâ€¯Self*, *SubtleÂ Spell*, and *TelepathicÂ Speech* to steer scenes.
\- **Plan the reveal**: Coordinate with the DM for a dramatic unmasking of his false cleric identity.

??? danger "DM Guidance"
\- Make sure Aramisâ€™s deception enriches party cohesion and doesn't derail it.
\- Introduce witchâ€‘hunters, suspicious clergy, or villagers who notice inconsistencies.
\- Offer opportunities for growth: exposure, possibilities to use the aberrant abilities for good (or bad), or moral conflict that forces action.

## Backstory (Short Form)

Fifteen years ago, novice Aramis discovered the abbot of his abbey embezzling alms. While his aberrant telepathy exposed the crime, he also outed himself. Branded a heretic, he fled and forged the clerical persona he still maintains. Each new town offers fresh coin and momentary refuge, but every night he drowns his guilt in wine and anonymity.

* A dying child whose cure forces him to choose between secrecy and compassion
