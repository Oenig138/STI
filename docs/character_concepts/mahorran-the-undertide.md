**A corporate Marid's one-woman pirate crew grinding it out on the high seas for that sweet promotion to branch manager. She boards ships in Darkness, wins fights by equal amounts of intimidation and drowning tactics, and retreats to her underwater garden for depressingly uneventful downtime with her turtles.**

**Age:** 33  
**Alignment:** Neutral Evil

??? info "Quick Intro"
    
    **At the Table**
    
    Initially, Mahorran is aggressively professional towards the party. She only really makes conversation when she interprets they're having a mandated break from work and she's expected to be social, and excuses herself to her vessel the moment her workday is up and social interaction becomes optional. The mystery isn't whether she has an evil patron, that's just the premise. The big question is whether there's anything underneath the job description at all?
    
    **Backstory (Short Form)**
    
    Since a young age, Mahorran operates in the Maritime Logistics Collective, first as a clipboard recruiter, now as a solo pirate (job title: enforcer-collector). The company's CEO is a Marid who styles itself King of the Sea. She boards merchant ships with ruthless efficiency and subdues or convinces crews to surrender any magical cargo. But now, her patron has ordered her to embed with an adventuring party for reasons she doesn't understand. She's stuck making small talk around campfires when she'd rather be repotting kelp in her Genie's vessel. She can't help but suspect she must have done something to make her patron cross, but she's a professional. If the party is her assignment, she intends to ace it.
    
    **Playing Mahorran**
    
    - **Combat:** Excellent battlefield controller, standard Warlock damage output, downright lethal in sea campaigns. Darkness/Devil's Sight are a classic combo, but don't always make her the best team player; she is equipped to work on her own.
    - **Roleplay:** Terse, professional, charismatic, but annoyed by all social obligations outside her professional role. Sees herself as a normal wage slave, hoping for promotion within a year or two. She's a woman of simple pleasures, genuinely lacking in imagination and creativity, just enjoying the grind. Her big recreative outlets are gardening kelp and sheltering her two pet turtles in her saltwater terrarium Genie Vessel, and reading truly undignified literature, from bodice rippers to werewolf pulp. She much enjoys the werewolf pulp, and cheap cider. She's entitled to one free day a week and will complain loudly if circumstances demand she adventure on her downtime (she will do it though, expecting compensation by the hour).
    - **Party Synergy:** Reliable in combat, follows orders and keeps people alive as per the job description, but bonding requires the party to actively drag her into engagement, using whichever pressure points they can device. Cider? Werewolf smut? Pretty seashells? With the right party, Mahorran's clammy personality is expected to slowly open up during the campaign, as she finally meets people outside the corporate success cult she calls a family.

??? info "Deep Dive"
    
    ## The Unseen Pirate
    
    Mahorran's method of piracy is simple and efficient. She scouts ships holding artifacts her patron may want using Detect Magic, stalks them by swimming after or hitching a ride underneath the hull. Then, at night, at the waterline, she moves. An attack with Thorn whip + Telekinetic Pull (Bonus Action) pulls a defender 10+5 ft, and gravity hands them to the ocean. Magical Darkness rolls in over board, she climbs up acrobatically and starts blasting from the Darkness, protected by Mage Armor. Repelling Eldritch Blasts send more defenders overboard.
    
    Then, a voice booms from the dark, commanding and amplified by Thaumaturgy, issuing instructions: Drop the weapons, fall to your knees, and stay just so... the King of the Sea demands it. If they comply, the fight ends early and Mahorran goes in her dark shroud to collect any Magic items in the cargo. Shoving her Genie's Vessel, a coral ring, through a hatch or window below deck, she disappears into the ring, which plummets discreetly into the water and is collected by her octopus familiar. By the time the Darkness lifts, the deck is quieter, the crew smaller, and no one is quite sure what they were fighting, only that it came from below, and it will likely do so again.
	
	When the crew fights back, Mahorran resorts to Hypnotic pattern for crowd control, picking the crew off one by one. If they manage to overwhelm her, Thunderstep serves as her final statement before she plummets into the sea and disappears.
    
    ## Personality
    
    Mahorran is neutral evil in the sense that she's professional about violence. She doesn't mind killing, but doesn't particularly enjoy it. It's inefficient, messy, and usually unnecessary when terror does the same job faster. The cruelty is structural, bureaucratic, not personal.
    
    Outside of work, she's an introvert who has spent years operating in solitude, interfacing with people only long enough to scare them into compliance. While she's naturally charismatic, sustained friendly interaction is a skill she never developed. When the cleric tries to have a heart-to-heart about faith and patrons, she responds with, "It's a job. Faith has nothing to do with it. I'm not looking for grace, I'm looking for a promotion. Branch managers get a larger vessel, they say."
    
    She's never asked what happens to the people she terrifies, never wondered what her patron does with the artifacts she collects. She genuinely doesn't see the emotional or moral dimension to her actions. She's just a cog in a machine she's not particularly interested in understanding, unless someone gives her a good reason. What she lacks in intellectual curiosity she makes up for in sheer personal tenacity. She's the one who can spend a full day sorting grains of rice, or putting square pegs in square holes. It's doubtful she even gets bored.
    
    **Personality Traits:** Flat honesty, blunt and task oriented. The party has to shout at the octopus to get her attention when she's hiding away in the vessel reading pulp or petting her turtles.
    
    **Ideals:** Efficiency, hard work, the satisfaction of promotion and a good review.
    
    **Bonds:** Her patron (professional loyalty), her vessel garden (the only thing she truly cares for), her closest boss Nikita Costa, and—eventually, reluctantly—the party members who keep treating her like a person despite her best efforts.
    
    **Flaws:** Fatal under-communicator, thinks reflection on morality is nonessential homework.
    
	## The Grind
	
	Mahorran hasn't really known much of life outside of the organisation of the King of the Sea. She started young as a clipboard recruiter for what she was told was a "maritime logistics collective with excellent vertical mobility." She learned to talk fast, hit quotas, measure up her marks and make the pitch sound appealing. She signed people up for something she didn't fully understand and never bothered to follow up on. By the time she realized what the operation actually was, she was already in too deep, the benefits were too good, and ultimately, her seniors told her it was just business. When she was promoted to third-class "enforcer-collector", it felt like real validation. A step up. She got her own vessel, magical powers, and got to boss  the newbies around whenever she visited the branch office.
	
	Mahorran’s Pact of the Tome serves double duty as a ledger for entering hauls, tracking profit over time and mapping expenses or dips in performance. She has a fixed work schedule, including one designated day off per week, during which she will not undertake adventuring activities unless circumstances force her to.
	
	Her patron evaluates her performance through regular reviews from the branch manager Nikita Costas. Mahorran is acutely aware of the review metrics even in combat situations, occasionally adjusting tactics based on what she believes will "read well".
	
	She competes with the rival warlock enforcer-collector Galvan for promotion, and underperformance carries the implicit threat of termination. She's seen others be terminated. It looked unnecessarily painful, and she's reasonably certain they died.
	
	## The Vessel
    
    The Genie's Vessel is a ring worn around one of her octopus familiar's tentacles. She spends more time inside than strictly necessary: she thinks a lot, plans a lot, and cares for her garden. The vessel is an opulent saltwater terrarium. Three feet of seawater cover the floor, kept oxygenated by living plants she's cultivated lovingly. Kelp anchored to the walls sways gently even though there's no current. Bioluminescent algae clings to surfaces, casting warm green light. Small anemones attach to stones. Slow-moving starfish and conches drift along the bottom, fish dart between pebbles and seaweed. 
    
    She even keeps two turtles. Found them as hatchlings, brought them in "temporarily," never released them. She doesn't tell anyone they're an extremely rare species, close to extinction. A male and a female. She's protecting them from predators, waiting for them to be old enough to mate and trying to keep conditions for them optimal in the vessel.
    
    Mahorran's typically lying in her hammock strung just above the waterline to not disturb the water, reading cheap literature, doing accounting or planning for the next review.
        
    ## Sample Quotes
    
    "By writ of the King of the Sea, this vessel is subject to inspection. You may comply, or you may learn why the sea keeps no witnesses."
    
    "No seriously, I get the gratitude, but I really wouldn't be here if I had a choice. So let's not get sentimental."
    
	"You remind me of a captain I drowned once. No, that's a compliment! He was really nice."
	
    "Only one more Magic item from a new monthly record. Gotta admit, you guys haven't been my worst assignment yet."
	
	"You want to take me... bar... hopping? Is this extracurricular activities? What's the policy and expectations exactly? And uh, do they serve cider?"
	
	"I'd like to meet a werewolf one day. No reason really. Just curious what they smell like when they get wet."
	
	"Of course my octopus doesn't have a name. It's a tool. But if you're gonna go ahead and call it anything, I guess Pierre will do. But don't."
    
    "You're less annoying than most dry-folk." (This is the closest she gets to expressing affection.)
    
    [When asked about the turtles] "They came with the vessel." (They absolutely did not.)
    
    ## Running the Character
    
    Mahorran's evil alignment is more professional amorality than active cruelty. She's only possibly dangerous when orders from up top conflict with party interests. 
    
    The Vessel is her safe place. Her turtle pets are her only truly personal project, her only object of genuine care. Her social awkwardness is intended as both comedy and character work: She has CHA 18 and could be very charming if she wanted to. But she doesn't. That can change. She's likely more fun to play if she participates in party activities unwillingly and badly rather than refusing entirely. 
    
	A few "hooks" to add to Mahorran's character to help the party pull her out of her shell: Fondness of cider, interest in cryptozoology, the animal magnetism of the werewolf legends, and bad literature. Other such hooks may surely come along during the campaign. She's been living the corporate grind most of her life. She hasn't really *done* a lot.

    **Compartmentalized Care**
    
    Mahorran doesn't lack empathy, she's just learned to contain it. Her capacity for care exists, but it's been sealed into one space, the vessel, so it won't interfere with her actual work function. She heard branch managers get a larger vessel, so she wants it (they really don't, at least RAW). But it isn't about status, but carrying capacity. More water, more living systems, room for her turtles to breed.
    
    When she says the turtles "came with the vessel," she's not being coy. She's performing risk management. If HQ learns about her terrarium and the turtles, it might just put its foot down. She can terrorize crews and drown sailors because she's learned to compartmentalize her capacity for care into one sealed environment that's her private life. Unfortunately, not even this is all hers. Her care for her pets is genuine. She could have been an accomplished Druid if she ever had the chance to realize what her true calling was.

??? info "Key Relationships"
    
    **The Marid (Patron)**: The Marid styles itself King of the Sea and runs a tight "The Office" style business. Mahorran is openly proud of the arrangement in a way most warlocks aren't. No shame, no existential crisis, just employment. The patron wants magical items collected, ships inspected, and its authority performed across the waves. In return, she gets power, perks and continued existence. It's transactional, professional, and she prefers it that way.
    
    Why the Marid ordered her to join this particular party remains unclear. Mahorran doesn't know, doesn't ask, and the uncertainty gnaws at her more than she admits.

    **Galvan The Riptide (Rival Warlock)**: The Riptide has been competing with Mahorran for years, and the King of the Sea plays them against each other deliberately for the role of branch manager after Nikita Costas retires. Both know falling too far behind means being terminated. 

    Galvan is far crueler than Mahorran. As a result, he harvests more Magic items, but he also gets in a lot more trouble. Somehow, Mahorran has managed to keep up, but the pressure is real.
    
	**Nikita Costas**: Current Branch Manager, about to retire. The closest thing Mahorran has to a friend and mentor. Nikita keeps it professional but it is clear she prefers Mahorran over Galvan once she steps down. But ultimately that's not her decision to make. Nikita is the one to index and identify all magical items coming in, making sure nothing dangerous is pushed up in the hierarchy.

??? danger "Notes for the DM"

    ## Dramatic Questions

    The first tension isn't whether Mahorran is good or evil—it's whether she's *anything* beyond her job description? Does she have values independent of the patron's orders? Does she care about people, or only about the grind? The vessel garden suggests capacity for care exists. The party provides the first opportunity to apply it to beings that can talk back.

    The second big tension: What does it take for Mahorran to stop performing when in the presence of others?

    ## Character Arc

    Mahorran's arc is imagined by the author to be about de-institutionalization, recognizing that "just following orders" is a moral evasion. The party provides the first context where her efficiency and compliance are questioned by people who aren't competitors or superiors. She'll resist this initially, because admitting the system is corrupt means admitting she's complicit. If this doesn't vibe with your table, please make necessary changes.
        
	## Adventure Hooks

	### General Plot Hooks
	
	**The Riptide Surfaces** A ship the party needs was already hit using familiar tactics: Darkness, drowning, forged writs, but messier. Mahorran recognizes Galvan's signature. Her rival operates nearby.
	
	**Cargo of Interest** The party acquires an item the Marid wants. Mahorran's orders: secure and deliver. But the item matters to someone in the party or has moral implications. Professional obligation versus emerging loyalty.
	
	**The Reason for the Job** Why did the Marid assign Mahorran to this party? Options: performance test, corrective action for unknown screwup, intelligence gathering, career development requirement, or the party is heading toward something the Marid fears or desires.
	
	**The Performance Review** The Marid requests satisfaction feedback from the party as part of Mahorran's evaluation. External assessment is rare. Negative feedback has tangible consequences. The survey measures not just performance (keeping party alive) but approachability, professional tone, and whether they'd recommend her to other parties.

    *From: Branch Office HR – King of the Sea Maritime Logistics Collective*  
    *Subject: Enhancing Employee Engagement & Public Relations Metrics – Immediate Action Required*  
    *Body snippet: "As part of our ongoing commitment to operational excellence and brand synergy, all field agents (Enforcer-Collectors Grade III and above) will now be evaluated on Interpersonal Engagement Metrics (IEM) over the next lunar cycle. Remember: Our employees are our most valuable asset, and our face toward the surface world. Positive peer feedback directly correlates to performance bonuses, vessel upgrade eligibility, and continued employment security. Be advised that informing the people providing feedback in advance is strictly prohibited, as this may tweak the metrics. Just be your actual charming self. *All hail the King of The Sea.*"
	
	**The Cease-and-Desist** Mahorran receives a memo citing vessel maintenance violations. Unauthorized fauna must be removed within ten business days. Standard corporate format: policy citations, compliance deadlines, performance review warning. Signed by Nikita, who had to process it before her termination. The institution comes for the one thing she's allowed herself to care about.
	
	**The Seven Seas Initiative** The artifacts weren't random targets—they're components of an imperial project. The Marid is assembling a fleet capable of controlling trade routes through magical and military superiority. Mahorran learns this through company-wide announcement unveiling the "Seven Seas Initiative." She's been arming an empire. Is "just doing her job" defensible when the purpose is domination at scale?
	
	**The Eggs** Mahorran discovers actual *eggs* in her vessel. The turtles have mated! She succeeded in protecting a near-extinct species long enough to reproduce. This is the proof that her care, given space, can create precious life. And she can't scale up. Hatchlings need room. She can't report it as unauthorized breeding is even worse than unauthorized pets. So will she abandon them? Or ask for help without admitting what she's done? Thanks to her fastidious adherence to details, she's successfully created something needing a future she can't provide within the system.
	
    ### Nikita's Ascension
    
    Years ago, Mahorran brought Nikita a psionic resonator artifact capable of creating pocket dimensions. Nikita never indexed it. She kept it, studied it, and built a liminal space that exists geographically relative to the Marid's attention, always situated orthogonal from its gaze.
    
    Nikita has seen others "get retired". There was always some reason why they had to be terminated prematurely. So, when the Marid issues her termination notice, she is ready. Through careful rituals, she's changed her fundamental nature, making the pocket dimension her actual home plane. She's prepared a Ring of Spell Storing with a Banishment spell. When termination begins, she triggers it as a prepared action as the Marid's Lightning Storm strikes, and banishes herself. To all observers, including the Marid, she's utterly destroyed. In reality, she's turned functionally invisible to her patron.
    
    From her liminal refuge, Nikita still accesses the pact network as the acting branch manager. Instead of making a visible dent on the power delivered to the branch's Warlocks, she's siphoned 5% off each. Now, she reroutes Mahorran's pact through herself, becoming Mahorran's patron through bureaucratic sleight of hand. Mahorran keeps her powers, the Marid doesn't notice, and Nikita has a single agent in the material world, to carry out her revenge.
    
    After Nikita's "termination," Mahorran's powers don't change. She still casts at full strength, still appears on the Marid's roster. But something feels different. When she meditates on the connection, she senses something smaller, warmer, achingly familiar instead of the Marid's vast cold presence. Nikita makes contact through dreams or cryptic messages in Mahorran's tome-ledger. She explains what she did and what she needs. Mahorran is now her only material agent, able to act on intelligence Nikita gathers from inside the pact network. New mission: infiltrate and sabotage the Marid's emerging Seven Seas Initiative from within. Nikita has finite resources, limited direct action, and only one warlock. But together with the party, they may still topple an empire. But Galvan, Mahorran's nemesis, is the first to realize something about his powers is off...

    **Content Notes:** Mahorran's neutral evil alignment means she'll follow party consensus for professional reasons but lacks intrinsic moral objections to methods other characters might find abhorrent. If the party needs a clear ethical floor, establish it in Session Zero rather than discovering conflicts mid-campaign.
