## Gameplay Notes

??? info "Playing Thimble effectively"
    - **Fight with sprezzatura**: Use Fighting Spirit (advantage + temp HP) to make combat look effortless and keep your bravado consistent. The table banter is half the fun. Lean into it!
    - **Control the field**: Polearm Master + Weapon Mastery gives you reach, bonus strikes, and reactions. You‚Äôre the wall that stops enemies from walking past.
    - **Play out the legacy**: His sling *Suna‚Äôs Roar* and mithral armor are mementos of his mother. Mention them in combat descriptions to sell Thimble's backstory.

??? danger "DM Guidance"
    - **Bring back Rai‚Äôs shadow**: The Izu-no-Kane clan should frame Thimble as a betrayer and accursed ingrate, no matter how just his actions. It fuels conflict without cheap villains.
    - **Test his fear of cruelty**: Put him in positions of power: leading troops, holding prisoners, and see if he can resist becoming what he dreads.
    - **Reward defiance**: When he calls out bullying or grandstanding (whether from NPC nobles or monsters), let it land narratively.
	- **Homebrew check**: Thimble has a home-brew sling called "Suna's roar", a memento of his mother. It's a Sling +1 with an extra 1d4 Thunder damage, and the *Thrown* property (so it can be wielded using STR instead of DEX).
