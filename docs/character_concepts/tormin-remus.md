## Backstory (Short Form)

Once a human farmer‚Äôs son, Tormin Remus watched his family hang for unpaid taxes. Desperate, he walked to a crossroads on a moonless night and made a pact with a devil for the power to fight back. The pact gave him changeling flesh, and then began erasing his identity one little piece at a time.

Now a myth whispered among revolutionaries, Tormin topples regimes through impersonation and subterfuge. He frees prisoners, spreads dissent, and vanishes before dawn. His flute carries the melody known as **The Traitor‚Äôs Tune**, outlawed by the nobles, loved by the oppressed. In reality, it is the one song that still anchors Tormin to the person he used to be: it is muscle memory and his mother's voice.

## Gameplay Notes

??? info "Playing Tormin effectively"
    - Play him as a symbol, not a loner. Tie him emotionally to at least one PC to avoid ‚ÄúMain Character Syndrome.‚Äù
    - Lean into the tragedy: a man who changes faces to fight oppression yet loses his own identity in the process.
    - Use charm and control spells (*Suggestion*, *Enthrall*, *Command*) as tools of rhetoric and propaganda.
    - His humor should be dry and weary, his tone half sermon, half confession.

??? danger "DM Guidance"
    - His revolution can become the campaign‚Äôs central moral test. Does the party stop him, or join him?
    - The devil‚Äôs patronage should feel inevitable ‚Äî every ‚Äúgood‚Äù choice should still cost him something.
    - Perfect mid-campaign twist: the revolution has succeeded, but Tormin is also finally transformed into a wraith without past or future.
    - His final act might be to vanish into the crowd as his tune spreads across the world.
