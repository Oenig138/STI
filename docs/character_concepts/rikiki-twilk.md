Rikiki Twilk is a bigâ€‘hearted, birdâ€‘brained zealot barbarian who atones for a tragic fire by protecting children, puppies, and the weak with unshakeable loyalty. He hits like a cart of bricks rolling downhill and has the moral subtlety of an anvil in decaying orbit.

* Earnest to a fault, incapable of irony; often comic in clumsiness.
* Fierce protector of children and the vulnerable; punishes actions, not identities.
* Trusting, loyal, and endlessly patient, but deeply gullible.

## Gameplay Notes

??? info "Playing Rikiki Twilk effectively"
	- Lean into big, earnest physical comedy (wrong doors, fruit stands, pratfalls) without devolving into random chaos.
	- Keep his voice simple and sincere: literal, never sarcastic, quick to befriend and to forgive.
	- Tactically, rage early and leverage **Divine Fury** plus **Heavy Weapon Mastery** (from Great Weapon Master) for burst damage.
	- Rotate mastery weapons between **Maul (Topple)**, **Glaive (Graze)**, and **Halberd (Cleave)** to fit the encounter.
	- Trust party members with nuance; Rikiki thrives when he follows allies' judgment on gray areas.

??? danger "DM Guidance"
	- Put visible injustices on screen: bullies, slavers, corrupt officials, child endangerment.
	- Use **Eloo the Kenku** as a recurring foil who tries to twist his sense of justice.
	- Reward moral stands with consequences (lives saved, enemies hesitating, allies stepping up), and let failure sting.
	- His arc is redemption through community; let him learn he doesnâ€™t have to carry guilt alone.
