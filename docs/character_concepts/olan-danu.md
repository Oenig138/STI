A jade-green tortle diplomat whose kindness doubles as strategy. Olan radiates calm rationality and impeccable manners, but beneath that warmth smolders the pragmatism of someone who‚Äôs seen too much folly to still believe people will do what‚Äôs right. Her abjurations are as layered as her diplomacy ‚Äî protective, firm, and quietly ruthless.

## Personality

* Calculated care, bittersweet wit. She forgives, but never forgets.
* Treats mercy as investment, views grudges as bad accounting.
* Habitually diplomatic, but her frog familiar *Fafnir* expresses what she won‚Äôt.
* Struggles with creeping misanthropy after years in politics.
* Most likely party member to call out the opponents for being hangry, offer snacks mid-fight and somehow manage to resolve the conflict.

## Backstory (Short Form)

Born to an archivist-ambassador family in the **Serene Concord of the Reedwater Throne**, Olan grew up mastering bureaucracy as a weapon. At her first diplomatic summit, she exposed corruption in the Fey Courts, only to be ‚Äúhonored‚Äù by being thrown into a cauldron for embarrassing her hosts. Her abjurations saved her life, scorching her shell with ember-like markings that now glow when she casts wards. Ever since, she has seen diplomacy not as the triumph of reason but as the art of surviving foolishness with grace intact.

## Gameplay Notes

??? info "Playing Olan Dan√π effectively"
	- Play her as a calm, polite realist: a person who believes in mercy because vengeance is inefficient.
	- Her frog familiar *Fafnir* is constantly unimpressed, but silently mirrors her true feelings. Use it for subtle social cues or humor.
	- Mechanically, she‚Äôs a denial wizard: her **Arcane Ward** keeps the party alive, and at later levels she can totally shut down most enemy casters.
	- Shell Defense makes her nearly unhittable and gives advantage on CON saves. Useful for high stakes concentration spells.
	- Use **Dragon‚Äôs Breath** on Fafnir the Frog for delightfully degrading roasting.
	- Roleplay her as an idealist who's been running on fumes for so long, she's often indistinguishable from a hardened pragmatist.

??? danger "DM Guidance"
	- Exploit her merciful pragmatism: test where kindness ends and cynicism begins.
	- Let past politics return ‚Äî envoys, ex-allies, or former prot√©g√©s now turned opportunists.
	- Olan works best when the moral stakes hinge on negotiation, trust, or restraint.
	- A perfect candidate for redemption arcs or lessons about faith in flawed humanity.
