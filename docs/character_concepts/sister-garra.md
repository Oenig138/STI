*Note on alignment: The Mud Nuns can be read as either Chaotic Good (breaking laws for the good of the poor) or Lawful Neutral (following the spiritual laws of their order, striving for cosmic balance). They are not merely rogues with prayer books, but true believers whose definition of "law" is dangerously at odds with the world's.

Sister Garra is a folk cleric of communal providence: half saint, half neighborhood menace. Raised by an ascetic order of urban nuns who "redistribute blessings" (always leaving a receipt with a short blessing to confirm the robbee has had their material illusions rebalanced), she uses divine trickery and theft as a sacrament to serve the poor, all while battling a looming spiritual mid-life crisis and her own penchant for comfy beds.

## Personality

  * **Psychological Trait:** Has a compulsive need to keep a ledger, tracking balances, items taken, and goods distributed.
  * **Moral Stance:** Believes "wealth without flow is spiritual poison" and considers theft from the wealthy a holy act of "correcting cosmic stagnation".
  * **Social Behavior:** More "alley cat" than "sexy cat burglar," she persuades with uncomfortable, sincere intensity rather than charm and wit.
  * **Mud Nuns**: A barefoot mendicant order in the city's seedy underbelly, embodying streetcorner religion and direct action.
  * **Struggles with Temptation:** Has been known to pause mid-heist in the Noble's manor to "meditate on the illusion of comfort" by taking a nap in the luxurious beds.
  * Most likely character in the party to know any random street urchin by name, bloodline and smell.

## Gameplay Notes

??? info "Playing Sister Garra effectively"
    - **Roleplay Advice:** This is her holy work, so avoid a roguish "isn't this naughty" attitude. She may be a thief, but she is sincere, perceptive, and driven by a powerful purpose.
    - **Characterization:** Lean into the low Charisma. Her attempts at persuasion should be blunt and awkward, not smooth. Consider having her tail twitch involuntarily when she's lying or agitated.
    - **Tactical Suggestions:** (controversial, check with your table) Use *Warcaster* to target the party Rogue with Invisibility when they leave your melee range, for free Advantage on their next attack.
    - **Cultural sensitivity:** The Mud Nuns are a concept deeply inspired by South Asian religious traditions. If you are a player from the Global North, please show sensitivity in your portrayal of this group. 

??? danger "DM Guidance"
    - **Narrative Risk:** Garra's order is being actively hunted by a rival faction, the Seekers of Penitence, creating a dangerous religious turf war. As she nears the age of becoming an elder, other nuns may look to her as a leader, a role she feels entirely unready for.
    - **Tension Generation:** Garra's missing mentor, Sister Nadya, may have defected to the Seekers of Penitence. She could be using her inside knowledge to systematically destroy the Mud Nuns, potentially forcing Garra into a painful confrontation with the woman who taught her everything.
    - **Opportunity for Crisis:** A younger, reckless nun has stolen a genuinely powerful and evil artifact from a noble, and the whole city is now hunting the Mud Nuns. Garra must find the sister and the artifact, forcing her to confront the dangerous consequences of her order's creed and decide where her moral lines are truly drawn.
