Exiled from a family determined to scrub away Feywild excess, Lia plays the part of the indulgent satyr stereotype: wine, glitter, and improvised magic tricks. Behind that mask is a woman carrying the scars of dyslexia and dyscalculia, branded as lazy and frivolous until she made it her persona. She‚Äôs messy, funny, and often underestimated.

## Gameplay Notes

??? info "Playing Lia Amberhorn effectively"
	- Lean into her **Wild Magic Surges** as Fey-flavored spectacle. Make her magic messy, sloppy and somehow still brilliant, emphasizing she's gifted, not try-hard.
	- **Spell Sniper** and **Lucky** feats showcase her hidden competence. She isn‚Äôt just slapstick, she can effortlessly land long-range hits and bend fate.
	- Play her messiness as **seasoning**, not the main dish. Hangovers, lost stockings, kittens in her backpack are fun color, but not her only note.
	- Use her strong **CHA** and decent **WIS** to negotiate, improvise, and occasionally surprise allies with flashes of brilliance.

??? danger "DM Guidance"
	- Calen Amberhorn (her younger brother) makes an excellent recurring antagonist: a merchant prince and secret warlock of Mammon who framed Lia for theft. His empire can intersect with multiple PCs.
	- Keep Lia‚Äôs antics from dominating the table. She works best when the chaos is shared, not monopolized.
	- Dyslexia/dyscalculia should matter without becoming the whole story. Spotlight her instincts and insight as often as her struggle.
