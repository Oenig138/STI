??? info "Quick Intro"
    
    **At the Table**
    
    * Bureaucrat with a burning conviction for collective action
    * Profoundly uncharismatic and literal-minded, constantly misreading social cues
    * Wants true justice through seizing the means of production; fears being celebrated as an individual hero
    * Tank and force multiplier who embodies heroic labor in service of the group
    
    **Backstory (Short Form)**
    
    Korak spent decades as a strong farmer and defender at a hobgoblin agricultural collective, happily single and working the land. When a traveling peddler sold him "The Harmonious Furrow: Theoretical and Practical Foundations of Agrarian Dialectical Organization," the dense political tome so moved him that he left to spread its message. Now he attempts to rally commoners against their masters, always fighting alone when others flee, becoming an unwilling folk hero celebrated in ballads—which he absolutely hates, since individual heroism contradicts everything he believes.
    
    **Playing Korak**
    
    * **Combat:** Frontline tank who uses Help action as bonus action (Fey Gift) to grant advantage to allies; Wolf Aspect rage grants pack tactics to the whole group
    * **Roleplay:** Stoic, literal, and preachy about collectivism; misses romantic signals entirely; goes on too long about soil pH and irrigation methods
    * **Party Synergy:** The sturdy, unflashy foil who makes everyone else shine brighter while carrying the group's physical burdens

    ## Full Background
    
    Korak grew up strong. He worked at a hobgoblin farming collective for many years, growing crops and defending the farmers from monsters, bands of raiders and tax collectors. Was constantly bad at reading signals from the women in the community and ended up single in his late forties. He was still happy enough, but one day a travelling peddler passed by, and he came upon a copy of the book "The Harmonious Furrow: Theoretical and Practical Foundations of Agrarian Dialectical Organization". It made such a deep impression on Korak that he felt he couldn't stay on the farm anymore. He had to go out and spread the word. "If we want true justice, we can't just guard these few fields… We must till the whole kingdom! Property is theft, and soil is sacred!" 
    
    While the others were sad to see their strongest warrior go, some did roll their eyes at his idealism and the way he clearly over interpreted some parts of a book that was frankly way too dense for him.
    
    Korak has become something of a folk hero after his many attempts to rile up the commoners against their masters. Too bad all those attempts end with the commoners fleeing as soon the guards pull out their swords. But Korak remains, does the work himself and hopes that they will learn. Plot twist: They never do. Instead, they lift him up as "the people's hero" and sing ballads about "Korak the Gilded", which is an epithet he absolutely hates. He wants to be just Korak, or possibly Comrade Korak. Singing the praise of vigilantes instead of pursuing collective action is against everything he believes in, and he actively tries to make people stop celebrating him.
    
    ## Personality Deep Dive
    
    Korak loves farming, animals and nature. He has strong communist ideals and is preachy about how good it would be if we all came together and acted. He considers it his duty to stand up for the little guy and is bad at just enjoying his downtime. Mostly he tries to rile up the common smallfolk against the local nobility, and ends up getting wanted for incitement. He has the soul of a visionary but the mind of a bolshevik bureaucrat, profoundly uncharismatic, unimaginative and collectivist in his mindset.
    
    Korak isn't stupid but he does have a bit of a one-track mind. If a lady hands him a flower wreath after he's helped her against the local landlord, he's most likely to commend her on their local soil acidity that produced such fine daffodils and ask about her preferred methods of irrigation.
    
    **Personality traits:** Bureaucrat with a burning conviction.
    
    **Ideals:** Seize and redistribute the means of production.
    
    **Bonds:** [To be determined by player/campaign]
    
    **Flaws:** Bureaucrat with a burning conviction.
    
    ## "The Gilded Hero" (Folk Ballad)
    
    Oh they say there's a man from the muddy east fields, 
    Who swung his big axe and made the guards yield! 
    They call him the Gilded, they call him the bold, 
    His swing's worth a kingdom, his heart's made of gold! 
    
    When the taxman came to take our last wheat, 
    Korak showed up, knocked 'im clean off his feet! 
    He swung for the widow, hacked for the plow, 
    The nobles did scheme, but they're trembling now! 
    
    Oh Korak the Gilded, he don't take no pay, 
    He fights for the small folk and then walks away! 
    He don't want your titles, don't want your fine plate, 
    Just give him a pitchfork and open the gate! 
    
    So raise up your mugs and your battered old hoe, 
    For Korak the Gilded, the people's big blow! 
    The man they call Korak, the taxman's big dread, 
    He swings for the many, so we keep our bread.
    
    ## Player Guidance
    
    Korak is a bruiser with a proletarian heart: a stoic, collectivist barbarian whose strength is in service of the group. He thrives when allowed to help others shine, boosting allies with Fey Gift, using the Wolf Aspect of Rage of the Wilds to grant advantage to the whole group, acting as a force multiplier and embodying the ideal of a heroic laborer.
    
    Do read the table though. If the party is stealth-heavy or morally ambiguous, Korak might need to play the quiet revolutionary. Either way, make sure your fellow players enjoy the same flavor of satire and sincerity.
    
    Be generous in your interpretation of "Help": Korak's whole identity is tied to his role as a support in both combat and narrative. Let your party lean on him, and look for moments where he can "carry the load."
    
    Lean into his inflexible personality. Korak isn't charming or inspiring. Play him with a literalist mindset, misunderstanding subtleties and social cues. Go on for a little too long about why gnats may be a sign of too low soil humidity. Make him the sturdy, natural foil to the more colorful, flamboyant characters in the party, so the group as a whole will shine the brighter.
    
    In combat, Korak's preferred strategy ties into his collectivist mindset. He uses the Help action as a bonus action in order to strengthen other party members via Fey Gift.

??? danger "Notes for the DM"
	
	## DM Hooks
	
	Korak works best in campaigns that leave room for political commentary, satire, or grassroots heroism. He isn't your average rage-monster, and the player is intentionally leaning into an unironic (but slightly tragicomic) portrayal of class struggle. Give him opportunities to rile up peasants, give heartfelt speeches, or sabotage unjust systems. The tension between his sincerity and society's indifference is what makes him memorable.
	
	Mechanically, Korak functions as a competent frontline bruiser and force multiplier. Make sure the player gets real tactical benefit from Fey Gift, especially in combination with pack tactics and the Wolf Aspect. If you're using enemy morale or loyalty systems, Korak's presence should shake things up.
	
	He only wants collective action, and a soil pH of about 6.5. You can see what happens if you try to push leadership roles on him, for fun or for challenge.
