## Personality

* Agreeable, chatty, helpful, insouciant, always with a kind word for everyone and the patience of a saint.
* Refuses to think ill of people, even villains: everyone is “just misguided.”  
* Genuinely loves hospitality and community, turning every gathering into a potluck.  
* Harbors the deep contradiction of being both the most wholesome grandpa and possibly the Herald of the Father of Lies.  
* Most likely party member to bring a cursed doll to daycare and say, “She’s a bit dramatic, but the children love her.”

## Gameplay Notes

??? info "Playing Harold effectively"
	- **Roleplay tone**: Always warm and sincere. Use pet names liberally (“dear,” “lad,” “duck”). Treat demons and nobles the same way you’d treat your niece’s fiancé. Never ever slip up the grandfatherly tone, not even when you roast goblins with infernal magic. Harold is the living embodiment of "killing with kindness".
	- **Mechanics**: Stack your many sources of temporary HP (Dark One’s Blessing, Inspiring Leader, Tough feat). You’re deceptively tanky. Eldritch Blast with Agonizing Blast is your reliable offense.  
	- **Ambiguity as a feature**: Never ever admit to evil, whether Harold is in fact a mastermind cultist or not. Reframe everything as wholesome misunderstanding. Treat infernal powers as odd but harmless coincidences, or regrettable consequences of other people's choices. 
	- **Leadership**: Use Inspiring Leader to give the party a “grandpa pep talk” before big fights. Roleplay these as cozy, not martial—“Now remember, chin up, shoulders back, and who wants a biscuit?”  

??? danger "DM Guidance"
	- **Ambiguity spotlight**: NPCs should disagree wildly about Harold. Some see him as the Herald of Lies, others as a beloved community figure. Let this ambiguity fuel party debate. 
	- **Cult hijinks**: Turn Harold’s Crimson Veil branch into a recurring HQ. Lean on misunderstandings (cursed nursery rhymes, chanting circles, demons queueing politely for stew, and obviously evil cultists looking equally bewildered by the tone shift of late, and enthusiastic about the number of new recruits to the cult).  
	- **Tone balance**: Play the horror of his powers straight and visceral, but contrast it with Harold’s cheer. The contrast is the point.  
	- **Plot hooks**: The central cult hierarchy may grow alarmed as Harold’s branch thrives. Fiends may genuinely believe Harold is a mastermind. Or the Father of Lies keeps him alive purely out of amusement.
