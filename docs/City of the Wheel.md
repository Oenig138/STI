# The City of the Wheel

*A 50-year-old theocratic city-state in the deep desert, sustained entirely by a single magical artifact — the Decanter of Endless Water.*

---

## Overview

In the dead heart of the Saharan sands rises **The City of the Wheel**, a walled and tiered settlement fed by a single **Decanter of Endless Water**.  
This magical artifact, housed in the **Source Tower** at the city’s heart, provides the only lifeline to tens of thousands of inhabitants.

Over fifty years, the city has grown from a happy retirement project of a band of adventurers into a tightly controlled **priest-engineer theocracy**. Water is life, law, and currency here — and those who control it rule absolutely.

## The Decanter of Endless Water

- **Location:** Sacred chamber at the top of the Source Tower.  
- **Function:** Produces 30 gallons of fresh water every 6 seconds (combat time), amounting to ~432,000 gallons per day.  
- **Access:** Only the **Order of the Wheel** may touch or adjust it.  
- **Security:** Heavily guarded day and night by elite desert police and engineer-priests.  
- **Symbolism:** Referred to as “The Source,” believed to be divine in origin. To threaten it is high heresy.

## The Rain Room

Directly beneath the Decanter lies the **Holy Rain Room** — the most sacred place in the city.

- **Design:** Circular chamber with a golden mesh floor, beneath which a cistern collects water.  
- **Mechanism:** A system of levers above can divert the Decanter’s flow entirely into the Rain Room, cutting off water to the rest of the city.  
- **Ceremony:** Bathing here is the city’s greatest honor, granted only to the ruler, high clergy, victorious generals, or foreign dignitaries.  
- **Impact:** When the Rain Room is active, the whole city knows — aqueducts run dry, and the absence of water reinforces the Order’s power.

## Governance: The Order of the Wheel

The Order is a closed, hereditary caste of priest-engineers who:
- Maintain the aqueduct system.
- Oversee city expansion and water allocation.
- Control population growth and immigration.
- Punish dissent by cutting water to individual districts.

### Political Nature
- **Structure:** The *Voice of the Source* (high priest-engineer) rules as both spiritual leader and chief hydraulic authority.
- **Enforcement:** A strong, disciplined **Desert Police** protect the Source Tower, patrol aqueducts, and guard the green belt.
- **Corruption:** Water rations are political tools; loyal districts get excess during festivals, rebellious ones get their taps sealed.

---

## The Thirstless — Rebel Movement

**Motto:** *Water for all, without the Wheel*  

### **Beliefs**
- Water is a divine gift meant for everyone, not the property of the priest-engineers.
- The Rain Room is an obscene waste, an idol to tyranny.
- The green belt should be expanded until no one goes hungry.

### **Reality**
- **Strengths:** Popular support in the outer ring, hidden caches of weapons, and a few sympathetic lower-ranking engineers.  
- **Weaknesses:** Poor organization, no infrastructure to protect the Decanter if seized.  
- **Risk:** A poorly planned seizure could lead to the Order retaking the Decanter within hours, using the rebellion as an excuse for mass repression.

## History: 50 Years in Brief

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| 0–5  | Founders (retired adventurers) build a fortified village around the Decanter. Water is free and plentiful. |
| 6–15 | Population surges as news spreads. Informal water wardens appear. First disputes over allocation. |
| 16–25| Water wardens formalize into the **Order of the Wheel**. Public service shifts to bureaucratic control. |
| 26–30| Coup during a crisis. Remaining founders killed or exiled. Voice of the Source installed. |
| 31–50| Full theocratic consolidation. Rain Room rituals begin. Expansion of palace district and covered aqueducts. Green belt established. Rebel murmurs grow in the outer ring. |

## The Source Tower and Aqueducts

**Source Tower**
- Tallest structure in the city, visible for miles.
- Whitewashed walls and inlaid mosaics of palm trees, waves, and rivers.
- Upper gardens reserved for the ruling elite.

**Aqueducts**
- Seven covered channels radiate outward from the tower, sloping slightly downwards.
- Each ends in a district cistern tower.
- Covered design prevents evaporation and sabotage.

---

## The City Layout (Year 50)

1. **Core:** Walled palace district with the Source Tower, Rain Room, and ceremonial gardens.
2. **Inner Ring:** Wealthy merchant and artisan quarters with private cisterns and shaded courtyards.
3. **Outer Ring:** Dense poor districts, communal taps, strict rationing, heavy police patrols, strong rebel presence.
4. **Beyond the Walls:** Shanty towns, seasonal markets, green belt farms, and dew harvesting stations.

## Water Recycling and Daily Life

Water is recycled and reused obsessively:
- **Greywater Systems:** Used bath and kitchen water filtered through reed beds and reused for irrigation.
- **Blackwater Composting:** Nightsoil collected, composted, and used in green belt farms.
- **Aquaponics:** Fish tanks feed vegetable beds in closed loops, minimizing evaporation.
- **Dew Harvesters:** Mesh structures collect morning condensation for supplemental use.
- **Palm Tree Avenues:** Shade streets, bind soil, and reduce surface evaporation.

### Sights and Sounds for Adventurers
- Women scrubbing laundry at public cisterns, their waste water funneled into vegetable beds.
- Guards locking down a district tower, and desperate residents pleading for mercy.
- The sudden silence when the Rain Room is in use — no water flowing, the whole city holding its breath.
- Shady courtyards where water trickles into stone basins, guarded by armed retainers.
- Outer markets selling ceramic water tokens redeemable at district taps.

## Adventure Hooks

### The Theft of the Source
- **High-Level:** A desert dragon steals the Decanter to create its own oasis. PCs must pursue it before the city collapses.  
- **Low–Mid-Level:** A rival city-state hires thieves to steal the Decanter during the Rain Room ceremony.

### Rebel Gambit
- PCs recover the Decanter — and the **Thirstless** beg for it to be handed over to them.  
- Moral dilemma: stability under tyranny, chaos under hope, or keeping it themselves.

### The False Flow
- The Decanter is swapped for an illusion or a Decanter of Endless Saltwater. PCs must find the real one before contamination spreads.

### Coup in the Wheel
- A faction in the Order cuts water to certain districts to force political change. PCs are hired to restore the flow or protect key cistern towers.

### The Elder’s Secret
- A dying founder hints at a *second* Decanter hidden in the desert. The Order and rebels both seek it — for very different reasons.

*The City of the Wheel thrives, but its heart beats to the rhythm of falling water. Without the Source, the desert will reclaim it in weeks — and someone will decide who lives and who dies.*
