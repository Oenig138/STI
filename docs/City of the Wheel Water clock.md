# The City of the Wheel — Water Clock

**Purpose:**  
To track the city’s survival time and escalating consequences when the Decanter of Endless Water is stolen, sabotaged, or fails.

---

## Base Assumptions

- **Population:** ~45,000–50,000  
- **Daily Water Needs (with rationing):** 10 gallons/person/day (~450,000 gallons/day)  
- **Stored Reserves:** ~1.5 million gallons (3–4 days of rationed supply in cisterns)  
- **Green Belt Buffer:** Can sustain minimal food production for up to 2 weeks without the Decanter, but requires water to stay viable.

## Clock Settings

Choose a starting point depending on the crisis:

| Scenario | Starting Point | Reason |
|----------|----------------|--------|
| Sudden Theft (Decanter gone) | Day 1 | No production, only stored reserves remain |
| Gradual Decline (output reduced) | Varies | GM sets drop rate; extend timeline proportionally |
| Sabotage / Contamination | Day 0–1 | May need to halt distribution immediately to prevent illness |

## Daily Countdown & Effects

| Day | Water Supply | Citywide Effect |
|-----|--------------|-----------------|
| **Day 1** | 75% reserves | Rations tightened, outer ring taps run half days only. Prices for water tokens double. |
| **Day 2** | 50% reserves | Long queues at district towers, desert police increase patrols. Rumors of hoarding. Rebels begin public speeches. |
| **Day 3** | 25% reserves | Outer ring on emergency rations. First fights break out at cistern lines. Order announces martial law in some districts. |
| **Day 4** | 10% reserves | Outer ring taps closed entirely. Riots in poor districts; rebels openly defy Order patrols. Inner ring begins hoarding. |
| **Day 5** | 5% reserves | Green belt irrigation halted. Crops start wilting. City gates closed to prevent mass exodus. Executions for water theft. |
| **Day 6** | 2% reserves | Disease begins spreading from contaminated standing water. Bodies in the streets. Rebel cells seize or sabotage aqueducts. |
| **Day 7** | 0% reserves | Full collapse: green belt dead, outer ring abandoned. Order retreats to palace district with remaining stores. Civil war or mass die-off inevitable. |

## Modifiers

- **Green Belt Buffer**: Add +2 days before complete collapse if the crisis starts at the beginning of the planting season.  
- **Weather Miracle**: A rare desert storm can reset the clock by +1 day (also makes for a dramatic story beat).  
- **Rebel Control**: If rebels seize a district tower, they may redistribute water — this can save lives in that district but hastens collapse elsewhere.  
- **Well Discovery**: Finding a deep well or ancient cistern can buy 12–24 hours of time.

## GM Tips

- **Show, Don’t Tell:** Describe physical signs each day — cracked lips, dust in the air, dried fountains, wilting palms, the stench of unwashed bodies.  
- **Escalate Conflict:** The later the day, the more desperate every faction becomes.  
- **Faction Opportunism:** Even as the city nears collapse, both the Order and the Thirstless will try to leverage the crisis to cement long-term power.  
- **Tighten the Clock:** If you want a high-pressure session, start at Day 3 instead of Day 1.

*When the Water Clock reaches Day 7 without restoration, the City of the Wheel ceases to function as a political entity — whatever remains will be something entirely new.*
