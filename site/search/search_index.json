He becomes Velvet\u2019s recurring rival and mentor, duelling her throughout the campaign. He offers begrudging lessons and measures her progress. But something keeps him busy and he never stays long. DM hook: The campaign's BBEG? He\u2019s stern but grows proud of her over time, promising to retire the day Velvet beats him. But before that day comes, Reed, who still only knows him as the man who humiliated them, slays him using a cursed blade. This robs her of closure and fuels a final, tragic confrontation.

His school begins to slip as challengers expose his limits. Pressured, possibly by his merchant patron and his own obsession, he seeks forbidden weapons. Eventually, he bonds with a cursed greatsword, becoming a Hexblade Warlock.

A child's dream turned nightmarish.</p> <p>Suggested Arc</p> <ol> <li> <p>Early: Velvet duels Garrick recurrently, losing but growing each time. Rumors of her \u201cfake style\u201d dog her steps; taverns and rivals mock her. </p> </li> <li> <p>Middle: Velvet discovers Reed's school. Their first reunion is bitter. He claims she abandoned the dream, while he preserved it. He continues running the scam while she proves herself in real duels. </p> </li> <li> <p>Escalation: Velvet starts winning duels that matter: guard captains, bandits, robber barons. She begins to inspire others, living her Oath of Glory. Reed, humiliated by comparison, becomes desperate. Garrick advices Velvet to not mind the haters and reassures her that she shows real growth. Nothing can take that away from her. </p> </li> <li> <p>The Cruel Twist: Reed kills Garrick with his cursed blade, robbing Velvet of her promised final duel with her rival. This is a great time to throw in a reveal: Maybe Reed has his own master, Garrick's rival?</p> </li> <li> <p>Climax: Velvet confronts Reed the Hexblade Warlock, now under the cursed blade's influence. The fight is as much about reclaiming their childhood dream as it is about stopping a monster.

He can finish her sentences, knows her puns, calls her \"Alveta\". Every flourish he makes evokes core memories in her. She sees the dark armor and remembers the tramp, the blushing boy.
