When Thorne later accuses \"the malcontents\" of consorting with hags, players who have met Maren should feel the dissonance immediately: that woman? Working dark magic? This mismatch is the first signal that characters in this adventure do not have the full picture.</p> <p>The Swann Defection: Maren's leadership has fractured. About half the Malcontents have broken away to seek protection from Lord Duncan Swann, a neighboring nobleman who has made vague promises about \"looking into their situation\" if they support his territorial ambitions against Thorne. Maren knows this is poison dressed as medicine\u2014Swann is notoriously brutal with his own tenants, and his interest in the Malcontents is purely strategic\u2014but she cannot make her people see it. They are desperate, winter is coming, and Swann is offering something that looks like hope. She has no good counter-offer except continued resistance with no guarantee of success.</p> <p>This parallel is thematically essential: the Malcontents seeking protection from Swann mirrors the Dreamstriders seeking protection from Moghara. In both cases, a vulnerable people under pressure turn to a power that presents itself as alternative when it is merely another expression of the same extractive logic. Swann didn't create the Malcontents' crisis (Thorne did), but he's happy to exploit it. Moghara did create the Dreamstriders' crisis, which makes her worse\u2014but the structure of the trap is identical. </p>"},{"location":"adventures/the-snipper-v4/#taalen","title":"Taalen","text":"<p>Dreamstrider, age uncertain\u2014he's lost count.

They might:</p> <p>Ignore it. The guards aren't breaking any obvious laws. The party has a job to do. This is someone else's problem.

Families who'd worked that land for generations were told to pay new rents or leave. Those who couldn't pay\u2014most of them\u2014lost everything. Her husband didn't survive the first winter. Now two dozen families live in shanties at the edge of what used to be their home, and the lord sends militia to make sure they don't get any ideas about taking it back.</p> <p>\"We tried asking nicely,\" she says. \"We tried the courts. We tried everything that's supposed to work. None of it did.

They think a new lord will be better than the old one. I've tried to tell them\u2014Swann is worse. His own tenants live like dogs. But my people are tired, and scared, and he's telling them what they want to hear. I don't have anything to offer except more fighting with no end in sight.\"</p> <p>This is important information, but players may not recognize its significance yet.

Several pages have been torn out\u2014specifically entries from his final weeks in dreamstrider territory. Later entries show methodical enclosure strategies applied to local peasants. A locked box holds dried coast leaf he claims he stopped using years ago. An insight check should have players ask themselves, \"why is he keeping something he stopped using years ago in a locked box?\" Aldric cannot explain why.</p> <p>The Staff: Servants describe collective dreams: standing in circles, salt water and black sand, a presence watching. One maid notices Lady Isra never seems surprised by these descriptions.</p> <p>The Guards: Confirm supernatural irresistible sleep, midnight to dawn. One older guard, Torm, remembers coast leaf and strange dreams from back when he served at the frontier as a young man, but he never made it deeper into the territories.</p> <p>Medical Examination: Any healer confirms impossible wounds. Perfect cauterization, no scarring, no pain. Surgical deletion rather than traumatic injury.</p> <p>Lord Thorne: Becomes uncomfortable but not evasive when questioned about colonial service. Genuinely disturbed by his inability to recall why he left. If asked about enclosures, he shows no awareness they mirror his colonial work.</p> <p>If the party mentions Lord Swann in connection with the Malcontents, Thorne's reaction is illuminating. He scoffs openly: \"Swann? Duncan Swann? He's one of the worst noblemen in the region, and one of those who mocked me most loudly for being 'too gentle with the smallfolk.' If those farmers think he'll treat them better, they're fools.\" This is both self-serving and true. Thorne genuinely cannot see that \"better than Swann\" is not the same as \"good,\" but his assessment of Swann's character is accurate. More importantly, this moment cracks open Thorne's self-image: he positions himself as moderate, reasonable, caught between ungrateful peasants and brutal peers. He has no framework for understanding that he and Swann are variations on a theme rather than opposites.</p> <p>Lady Isra: Maintains careful performance. Answers factually but volunteers nothing. Perceptive characters notice: she never suggests solutions, never asks about cures. Her concern is technically performed but emotionally absent.</p> <p>If asked about coast leaf, her contempt flashes through: \"That's cousin to our sacred kelp. You people take everything and corrupt it. The plant unprepared is a doorway you can't control.\" She might explain the dreamstriders knew the wild kelp's dangers\u2014their ancestors developed ritual techniques specifically to make navigation safe. The crude smoking method is precisely what their elders warned against.</p> <p>If asked about her marriage, her mask slips differently\u2014not contempt but something colder. \"He believes he saved me. He believes I should be grateful.\" She will not elaborate unless the party has earned significant trust.</p> <p>In Isra's chambers is dried kelp in wax-sealed containers, a brazier for controlled burning, notes in dreamstrider language describing Dream navigation.</p> <p>The Village: The displaced families live in makeshift shelters near former common lands\u2014a shantytown of salvaged timber and desperation. Armed militia patrol the perimeter, and the tension is immediate: these are people under siege, not simply poor. Signs of recent confrontation mark the camp: a burned structure (the cause is disputed\u2014see below), fresh graves, faces that track the party with exhausted wariness.</p> <p>Maren speaks for the camp, but her authority is visibly contested. The Malcontents have fractured. Those who remain with Maren are the ones who either trust her judgment or have nowhere else to go. The others\u2014roughly half the original group\u2014left weeks ago to seek Lord Swann's protection.</p> <p>The Swann Defectors' Fate: If the party asks about the defectors, Maren's expression goes flat. \"They went to Swann. He heard them out. Then he had his men beat them bloody and dump them at the crossroads. Said he doesn't harbor 'malcontents' and if they wanted his help they should have thought of that before making trouble for their betters.\" Some of the beaten families crawled back to Maren's camp. Others scattered. A few are simply gone\u2014whether dead, fled, or in Swann's dungeons, no one knows.</p> <p>This information is crucial for defusing the \"Swann is behind it\" theory that players may be nurturing. Swann is a brutal opportunist, not a mastermind. He was happy to dangle hope in front of desperate people when it cost him nothing, and equally happy to crush them when they actually showed up asking for help. He's not connected to the curse. He's just another lord doing what lords do.</p> <p>The Burned Barn: The party may ask about the burned storage barn mentioned in their briefing. Maren doesn't deny that it happened, but the details remain contested even within her own camp. Some say it was a deliberate strike against Thorne's resources. Some say it was an accident during a supply raid that went wrong. Some whisper that it was the Swann defectors, trying to force a crisis that would make Swann's \"protection\" seem necessary. Maren herself won't say who did it or why. What she will say: \"A barn full of grain burned. Grain grown on land that was ours. By hands that used to be ours. I won't weep for Lord Thorne's ledgers.\"</p> <p>GM Note: Keep the barn burning ambiguous. The adventure doesn't need to resolve this question, and leaving it open preserves the moral complexity of the resistance. What matters is that the players understand Maren's people are not unified, not pure, and not in control of everything done in their name.</p> <p>Mosley: Mosley positions himself as helpful but indispensable. He knows how Thorne thinks, how colonial campaigns were run, how coast leaf \u201ckept men functional.\u201d He tries to steer the investigation toward Maren\u2019s people, toward curses, anything that keeps attention off the past and buys Moghara time to carry out her procedure on Aldric Thorne. He will openly defend Aldric\u2019s enclosures as \u201cnecessary discipline,\u201d the same language he once used for pacification.</p> <p>If the party presses him about his service with Thorne, his story stays vague until they corner him. Then he admits he still smokes coast leaf, that it gives him \u201cclarity,\u201d and that Aldric once took the same comfort. If later on confronted with the kelp\u2019s dream-effects or Moghara\u2019s influence, Mosley grows cold and quietly dangerous: he will threaten, sabotage, or even attempt murder rather than let the truth surface.</p> <p>If the party gets too close to uncomfortable truths, steering them toward the stash becomes a disposal method for Mosley: \"You want answers? Aldric used to smoke this and see things. Maybe it'll show you what you need.\" He's feeding them to his mistress, Moghara.</p> <pre><code>*Aldric Hardened: If the party accepts Mosley\u2019s framing that violence is tragic but required, that Maren\u2019s people are the real problem, that Aldric\u2019s suffering proves he is being unfairly persecuted, Aldric retreats into the old colonial logic. Mosley becomes his living reminder to stop questioning his past.*\n\n*Aldric Humbled: If Mosley is exposed, forced to admit his bargain, his addiction to coast leaf, his willingness to let Aldric be carved apart rather than lose the old order, Aldric is confronted with his own reflection. This is what he was. This is what he almost still is. The shame is inescapable.*\n</code></pre> <p>Petra: Petra watches everything. She cleans Isra\u2019s rooms, smells the kelp smoke, constantly watches her for micro-expressions. She will eagerly whisper to the party that Lady Isra is a witch who brought this curse with her. Her bigoted hatred is obvious. If the party indulges her, she will give them access: keys, rumors, half-overheard conversations. She will happily sneak them into Isra\u2019s chambers. But she will also sabotage any attempt at trust, spreading poison that makes cooperation with Isra almost impossible.</p> <p>If the party challenges Petra\u2019s racism, separates what she has seen from what she assumes, she becomes less useful but more honest. She still points them toward the kelp, the brazier, the midnight rituals, but without trying to turn it into a story of foreign corruption.</p> <pre><code>*Isra Hardened: If Petra is encouraged, Isra becomes more isolated, convinced no one sees her as anything but a threat. She retreats into bitterness and revenge.*\n\n*Isra Humbled: If Petra is confronted and contained, Isra feels less isolated. That fragile crack makes solidarity with the party and with Maren possible.*\n</code></pre> <p>The Coast Leaf Connection: If the party cross-references Thorne's journal with his coast leaf use, the pattern emerges: every mention of smoking is followed within days by strategic insights about the dreamstrider threat.

The man whose folly and cruelty caused all this?\" This may shut down further conversation and make future attempts to gain his trust harder.

You don't even know where you are.\"</p> <p>She makes it clear everything has a price, but is hazy on the specifics. Any character who actively agrees to a bargain (needs to be clearly expressed by the player) wakes immediately in their body. For the rest of the adventure, they suffer severe disadvantage in any confrontation with Moghara or her agents. They have already been partially claimed. But their wish will actually be met, within reason. On a very high Perception check, another party member may notice something wrong: a single, impossibly fine thread of spider silk disappearing into the bargainer\u2019s ear. If they try to pull it, it never ends. The front of the thread vanishes as it is drawn, leaving no coil behind. It cannot be removed by force. It will remain there until the character\u2019s contract is destroyed, or until Moghara comes to collect.</p> <p>This episode establishes at the very least that the Dream is inhabited by a predatory spirit, teaches the players that deals are the currency here, and may plant the idea that Aldric\u2019s suffering is not necessarily a curse, but a collection.

This requires destroying his personal contract and escaping before Moghara can retaliate. Tactical sequence: Draw Moghara's attention (conversation, provocation), suppress or evade the children (combat, stealth, Taalen's limited authority), locate and destroy the contract (physical action), flee. This is achievable without touching the Dreamstrider situation at all. It saves one man, leaves everything else unchanged, and represents the party choosing limited good over risky better. Aftermath: Aldric lives, Dreamstriders remain bound, Moghara continues her patient extraction, nothing fundamental changes. More focus on whether Isra and Aldric are Hardened or Humbled.</p> <p>The Information Play The party attempts to change the game by revealing Moghara's manipulation. This requires extended engagement: they need to occupy Moghara, suppress the children, reach the Dreamstriders, communicate complex information, and protect the resulting deliberation. The tactical sequence is staged: opening engagement splits attention, combat creates windows, communication happens in fragments across multiple approaches, eventual Dreamstrider consensus triggers Taalen's authority. This is slower and more dangerous than the rescue run, but opens renegotiation as a possibility.</p> <p>Structure this as a skill challenge with multiple stages: early failure means incomplete information transfer. The party will have to fall back on simply saving Aldric. Later failure means the Dreamstriders do not necessarily believe the party. New attempts can be made, but are risky as the encounter drags on. The aftermath depends on what information reached the Dreamstriders and whether they achieved consensus. If they did, and the party survives the time deliberating, Taalen invokes deliberation clauses and enter formal dispute. The Dream becomes a courtroom. The party has created space for the Dreamstriders to exercise agency they didn't know they had. The party will likely want to help, but are now thrown out of the dream by Moghara.</p> <p>Important: This mustn't feel like a sudden, cheap door slammed in their face. As they're being thrown out, let them catch a fragmentary impression: Taalen's voice rising in formal cadence, Moghara's fury condensing the Dream around her, the Dreamstriders standing rather than suspended. They look proud and focused now, knit together by the strength of their collective: A weave thicker than that of the Spider's. Moghara throws them out because they've genuinely threatened her position. Her anger at losing control of the ritual space is a form of victory confirmation. If she were merely annoyed, she'd let them watch; her violence in removing them signals they accomplished something she didn't want accomplished.</p> <p>Isra (if alive) is still sleeping, taking part of the negotiations as part of her people. Her reaction when she finally wakes becomes crucial. If she's Humbled, she will be weeping. She felt her people deliberating, witnessed the invocation of clauses, and for the first time in fifteen years taking a stand. The negotiations were still ongoing when the Kelp failed and she woke up, and she doesn't know what happens next. That uncertainty is her people's agency made visible. If she's Hardened, her reaction might be different\u2014cold pride, grudging gratefulness that the party interfered.</p> <p>The Catastrophe: The party can find and destroy the Dreamstrider contract. If they try to tear it apart, Moghara tries to stop them. But if they succeed, her demeanor shifts. At first, she is annoyed, then the annoyance turns to petty cruelty. Taalen starts screaming.

The party, the collective Dreamstriders, everybody in the space must flee. This is not a fight they can win. The Dream itself becomes hostile as they scramble for the exit\u2014architecture shifting, paths closing. This is the Freddy Krueger ending.</p> <p>If they didn't also destroy Thorne's contract, he dies, killed almost instantly. Taalen's fate is worse than death: no longer a steward with borrowed power but simply prey in a hunting ground he can never leave, with a predator who has no more reason for patience, but insatiable rage to take out on her plaything. The dreamstriders are \"free\" of their bargain. But the Dream is now hostile territory forever, and anyone who enters becomes prey without rules or protections.</p> <p>Note: The Catastrophic ending may need to be telegraphed. Many players will default to destroying the contract. It is a staple of the 'infernal contracts' trope and especially if they succeeded to destroy Thorne's contract and saw him and his men be whisked away, they may think this is just how it works. Video game logic. Make sure they learn that Moghara is a predator first and foremost. She can play nice but she is not obliged to unless bound by a contract. Taalen should warn them directly: \"That contract is their cage but also their shield. Burn it and you free us all\u2014including her.</p>"},{"location":"adventures/the-snipper-v4/#the-moves-available","title":"The Moves Available","text":"<p>Engaging Moghara directly  This occupies her attention but puts the engaging party members at severe risk. She'll offer deals, make threats, probe for weaknesses. This is valuable to create space: while she's focused on conversation partners, she's not watching the web-bound witnesses or noticing what Taalen is doing. Track this as attention economy: Moghara can focus on one thing intently or monitor several things loosely. Direct engagement forces focused attention.</p> <p>Running interference on the children  The children respond to threats against their mother's interests and will attack and kill Dreamstriders if they stop complying. Players drawing their attention away from the Dreamstriders or Taalen create communication windows. Frame combat as rounds purchased rather than enemies defeated. Even losing a fight accomplishes something if it bought four rounds of distraction.</p> <p>Communicating with the Dreamstriders  This requires: physical proximity to the web-bound witnesses and Moghara's attention is elsewhere/or the party member rolls a successful stealth check and the children are occupied. If all conditions are met, a party member can share the crucial information: Moghara engineered the colonial attack, the Coast Leaf gives her reach she hasn't disclosed, their protector manufactured the threat she protects them from. This gives the Dreamstriders grounds for renegotiation. But, this demands that the Dreamstriders believe the party. This demands a very high skill check. The party members can spend additional turns getting the info to more Dreamstriders, lowering the difficulty of the check.</p> <pre><code>- If Isra is actively with them, this check is a lot easier.\n- If Aldric is *Humbled*, awakened from paralysis, knows about the deal he struck, *and* is somehow brought physically to the Dreamstriders, he can disclose that this is the truth. This auto-succeeds the check.\n- If Maren testifies (see below), reduce the deliberation time by one full round.\n</code></pre> <p>If the check succeeds, the Dreamstriders announce they are going to deliberate, and ask the party to be patient. They immediately disappear from the battle, striding into their own ancestral Dreamspace. They will return after three more rounds of combat (two if Maren testified), and will then instruct Taalen to invoke clauses. Taalen will then invoke emergency deliberation clauses, freezing the ritual as well as the combat.</p> <p>Bringing Maren into the Dream If Isra has been Humbled and has connected with Maren during the investigation, she may choose to bring Maren into the Dream as a deliberate act of solidarity. This requires Isra to explicitly offer and Maren to accept\u2014neither will happen automatically. Isra must believe that showing the Dreamstriders a local victim of the same pattern will matter. Maren must trust Isra enough to let herself be pulled into a space she doesn't understand.</p> <p>Maren cannot fight in the Dream. She has no levels, no combat training, no magical protection. If targeted by Moghara or the children, she will die. Therefore she enters as a witness, not a combatant: she remains near Isra, shielded by whatever grace Isra's preparation affords a passenger. She cannot take actions, cannot be targeted by area effects (Isra's presence protects her), and cannot move independently. But she can be perceived by the Dreamstriders.</p> <p>If the party successfully reaches the Dreamstriders and makes their case, Maren can then speak. Her testimony is not information\u2014the party has already delivered that. Her testimony is recognition. She tells them what enclosure cost her. She tells them her husband died because a lord decided the common land was his now. She tells them she burned a barn (or didn't\u2014she won't clarify) because she had no other language left. She tells them she doesn't know anything about spiders or dreams or people across the ocean, but she knows extraction when she sees it, because she's lived under it her whole life.</p> <p>The Dreamstriders don't need to debate whether the party is telling the truth. They've heard from someone who has no stake in the Dream at all, only a stake in freedom. The pattern clicks into place faster because Maren makes it visceral. She is proof that the structure repeats independently, that Moghara is not unique, that what happened to them is happening right now to someone else who never heard of them.</p> <p>Mechanical effect: If Maren testifies, reduce the Dreamstriders' deliberation time by one round (from three to two). This is significant: one fewer round of combat the party must survive, one fewer opportunity for things to go catastrophically wrong.</p> <p>Destroying Lord Thorne's Contract  This requires locating the pulsing document-organism attached to Moghara, reaching it, and damaging it enough to sever its terms. Moghara will defend it, but not absolutely. Lord Thorne's contract is a minor holding, and protecting it isn't worth risking more important goals. If she's occupied elsewhere and the children are distracted, a party member can reach and destroy it. Aldric and his guards, all members of the household affected by the magic of the contract, are immediately expelled from the dream as the power binding them there is unravelled.</p> <p>Destroying Player Contracts Any players who made deals with Moghara are at severe disadvantage in any rolls of aggression, deception or coercion against her. But they can strongly feel the presence of their contract in the Spiderweb of Moghara's dream existence, and can attempt to destroy them to remove the disadvantage. Upon destruction, they lose whatever gift they received from Moghara.</p> <p>Empowering Taalen  Taalen does not join his people for the deliberation. He has steward authority under the contract, so he can command the children within limits and invoke procedural terms Moghara must honor. But he's been broken by eleven years of servitude. The party can at any time try to recruit him, but need three things:      1. Moghara's attention is elsewhere.      2. Tell him the truth about Moghara's manufactured crisis.     3. Give him hope that the party can actually create consequences for Moghara, not just annoy her.          - If the party have destroyed lord Thorne's contract, that counts. </p> <p>If the party manages to recruit Taalen, he can help the party immensely, but only on turns when Moghara's attention is elsewhere. He can force all Moghara's children to retreat for one whole round. He can wake Aldric Thorne and all his guards from their paralysis. He can heal party members in need. </p> <p>Awakening Aldric and his Men Aldric and his four guards can join the encounter if freed from the magic of paralysis. The Guards can aid in the combat encounter. Aldric Thorne can keep Moghara occupied by demanding a renegotiation of his contract. </p> <pre><code>- If both Isra and Aldric are present *and* Humbled, she can Awaken him herself. \n- Taalen can Awaken them all in one turn.\n- Any party member can attempt to Awaken them with either Medicine or Arcana checks.\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"adventures/the-snipper-v4/#aftermath","title":"Aftermath","text":""},{"location":"adventures/the-snipper-v4/#aldric-thornes-fate_1","title":"Aldric Thorne's Fate","text":"<p>Dead: Collection completes.

Since then, he's ran into Velvet a few times, the first time notably when seeking shelter at the monastery after a tough fight. Velvet, still salty about their last encounter, immediately challenged him to a rematch. Even while hurt, Garrick agreed. But this time he didn't just subdue her, but actively mentored her. For the first time in her life, Velvet received something akin to a lesson. He was gruff, clearly in pain, but he treated her as a fellow martial artist, and that meant something. With time, he became Velvet's recurring rival and mentor, offering begrudging lessons and measuring her progress.

Alphonse remembers Reed as the more promising student, and while he likes Velvet he never thought she was gonna be the one of them to make it.

Her Air Genasi nature remains a mystery. As Velvet grew up, her flighty nature soon became apparent. Her speed was unmatched to the point where the other village kids didn't even try to catch or compete with her. But while running was fun, it was swordplay that mesmerized her. She grew up sparring with sticks in the woods, dreaming of glory with her closest friend in the whole world, Reed. He was a simple village kid, but quick, smart and strong. Soon it became apparent he was the only kid around who could match her. Together they invented the \"Two Winds One Will\" style of fighting, although it should be said, Velvet was the engine and Reed the tag-along.</p> <p>As they grew older, villagers would tease them for always sneaking off into the woods together. One time they even tried to prove the rumors true, fumbling, giggling, and ultimately breaking apart in embarrassed laughter. And still they went back to the sticks, to the sound of wood colliding, because that was what mattered to them. Their dream of creating something bigger than themselves.</p> <p>Later still, when they were old enough to go earn a living and their techniques had grown sophisticated, Velvet's gaze turned to the roads. The forest provided, but chances to test her mettle were few. Her parents weren't happy, but they knew better than to try to contain her. Convincing Reed to tag along proved easy enough.</p> <p>Somehow, they ended up turning their swordplay into a con. It was never their intention, but precarity soon taught them that spectacle outpaced earnesty. Traveling with peddlers and outcasts, they sold their \"secret Air Genasi style\" to gullible townsfolk. They got to practice their dream and get paid! They lived as tricksters, cheap but on their own terms, performing rehearsed \"clashes\" in the day, training the curious village kids in the evening, then sneaking off in the night. </p> <p>Then, something went horribly wrong.</p> <p>None of them was a trained instructor. They improvised and feigned competence as they went along. They were so sure their dream could carry them. So when the mayor's son begged to try the acrobatic Falling Leaf spin, Velvet just shouted 'You can do it!' That was their mantra. The snap still wakes her some nights.</p> <p>They fled in terror. For another week, they trained no one, keeping a low profile and taking simple jobs on the road. But the pay was bad, and the itch to follow their dream was strong. Vowing to never teach dangerous acrobatics again, they re-branded their itinerant secret style show, barely dodging the Wanted signs. Until a wandering, grizzled fighter by the name of Garrick Pike saw through their ruse, swiftly defeated them both in a humiliating public 2v1 duel and handed them to the magistrate as charlatans and delinquents, for a pretty penny. Their paths split. Velvet was sent to a monastery, Reed to a wealthy philantropist merchant's tutelage. </p> <p>Velvet was not built for a life behind walls. She was an absolute menace, taking every opportunity to sneak out to practice. She slept through her lectures on morality or spent them theorizing parries and flourishes, taking notes on everything but the tenets of the faith. </p> <p>With time, she did come to terms with her irresponsible past, however. The turning point came shortly before she turned 18, in the form of a letter from the dead boy's mother, forgiving her. </p> <p>The very next day, following upon a long, sleepless night, Velvet swore an Oath, but not to any god. Instead she directed it to her dream, that her life project Two Winds One Will would become something worthy of that forgiveness, to become a tool for people wanting to perfect themselves, defend their loved ones and uphold justice. The style would become something real and responsible.</p> <p>But once out of the monastery, to her surprise, many already knew of her \"Two winds, one will\" style. And they sneered in her face. Even worse, the ones who did not sneer or laugh, claimed to have trained the style and showed horrible swordsmanship. Soon she learned that someone introduced a \"Twin Winds Academy\" in several cities well over a year ago, and made big money training noble kids in the flashy and eye catching techniques. As it became the hobby of the young and privileged, it also quickly spread to the villages. But within a few months it was abandoned or prohibited in most villages, due to the dangerous acrobatics and brutal moves that turned sparring sessions into morbid gambles.</p> <p>Their style always had an edge: moves they invented as teenagers that worked a little too well. The Reaping Wind. The Twin Sirocco. Velvet abandoned them after the mayor's boy died. Now she saw the village kids aspiring to be adventurers or town guards do bastardized versions of these same moves, with no restraint, no care for anything but the sense of \"looking cool\". Their minds were trapped in ego and spectacle, not in achieving actual results, or growing as people.</p> <p>Velvet didn't want to believe Reed would do something like that, but she could think of no other explanation. Nobody else could even know those moves. Now her mission was double: by ways of heroic deeds restore the honor of the dream that had carried her throughout her life, and eventually find the emotional courage to seek out and confront her childhood friend.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"character_concepts/alveta-velvet/#personality-psychology","title":"Personality &amp; Psychology","text":"<p>Though mocked as a fraud, Velvet duels to inspire others and redeem the dream she and Reed once shared.

Reed spent years believing he was unforgivable, which made him desperate enough to accept the cursed blade.</p> <p>The Letter as Quest Object: Velvet might discover Reed's letter while investigating the merchant's operations, or learn about it from another victim. The letter becomes crucial to Reed's redemption: proof that he had a choice, that someone forgave him, that the path Velvet took was available to him all along. When confronted with this knowledge, Reed must choose: continue serving the blade's hunger, or break the pact and face his pain honestly.</p> <p>The Final Choice: In their climactic duel, after Velvet has beaten Reed down to near-defeat, she presents him with the letter. This is the moment that determines everything. Does Reed drop the cursed greatsword and accept that he deserves forgiveness?

More useful: Her monastery may have information on the merchant and the being that has entered a pact with Reed. Velvet can go there to learn more, but not without having a serious and potentially very awkward talk with Falese. </p> <p>Optional Sidequest: Immaculate deception Falese has spent their correspondence urging Velvet toward a cleaner life. Now she's in a compromised situation: She tried to save a family of refugees from being handed over to a cruel magistrate by the church authorities. To do it, she had to lie, creating false baptismal records to grant them sanctuary. But she\u2019s a terrible liar. The High Inquisitor has flagged the records as suspicious and is coming to audit the archives in the morning. If caught, Falese loses everything. Velvet's the only one she knows who may be able to save this, and she has to ask for help. When she does, Velvet can get a chance to demand an honest position from Falese: Either accept her for who she is, with her whole toolkit and outlook on life, or they go their separate ways. </p> <p>Garrick Pike: Having him come and go through the story, performing short duels with Velvet, can build a strong relationship. He can also be a questgiver (\"When I was in Waterdeep I heard talk of a fighting competition with some big names coming. Go check it out if you want to be properly humbled, whelp\") or relayer of news and rumors pertaining to your main plot. He may have battled a lieutenant of the BBEG and survived, bringing news of their movements or plans. </p> <p>Optional Sidequest: The big reversal  Garrick has actually been on the run for a long time from debt collectors. Turns out, Velvet's \"straight mentor\" was never a stranger to the crooked lifestyle himself once. Word reaches the party that Garrick has been taken by strange enforcers from a foreign land (\"Ah yes, that gruff guy you used to spar? He passed through the village not a week ago... in irons. Herded by an unsavory bunch with ill intentions I reckon.\") </p> <p>What's his reaction when she finds him in irons? Shame? Bluster? Does he try to talk her out of helping? That conversation is just as important as any combat encounter. Make it tough, possibly morally fraught. Eventually, Velvet may get to save her \"mentor\" right back, making them narratively even. When his own unsavory past comes out, they're also spiritually even.</p> <p>Alphonse Collier: Alphonse asks Velvet for a favor. Nothing sinister, nothing that crosses her oath\u2014just something morally grey enough that she has to decide whether \"honor among thieves\" still binds her. He won't guilt her if she refuses. He'll just nod, adjust his estimation of her, and the old warmth will cool by exactly one degree for their future interactions. </p> <p>He responds very well to flattery about the haberdashery of a hat he has no business owning, but wears like a crown. Velvet knows this and may warn the party in advance. If they play along convincingly, he'll warm to them faster than his transactional nature would normally allow. If they mock it, he won't retaliate, but he'll never fully trust their judgment again. </p> <p>This is a chance to show rather than just tell the party about Velvet's sketchy past as a con. They watch her become someone who knows things they don't, someone with a history that operates by rules she's never had to articulate before. And then Alphonse walks in wearing something genuinely absurd and they have to keep straight faces while complimenting it (maybe ask them to roll Deception checks if their initial reactions call for it). Meanwhile, she falls into a completely different register\u2014reading his body language, matching his cadence, like it's muscle memory.</p> <p>Alphonse's the version of her that never got caught, never went to the monastery, never received the letter. And frankly, he's doing fine. He'll share a meal with them, offer genuinely useful information, maybe even do them a favor if the price is right. The party paladin's friends will hopefully find themselves almost liking him, and then catching Velvet pocketing something without thinking about it, or lying smoothly to a merchant about provenance, and realizing: oh, this guy is where that came from.</p> <p>Optional sidequest: Back to the Couture  If the party likes Alphonse, and you have time for a more lighthearted \"bottle episode\" in your campaign, Read a pitch for a fun, character-driven, low-stakes time heist here! </p>"},{"location":"character_concepts/alveta-velvet/#combat-stats","title":"Combat Stats","text":"AC HP Hit Dice Speed Initiative Prof. Bonus 17 44 5d8 35 ft. +4 +3 <p>Saving Throws: Wisdom: +4, Charisma: +7 Resistances: Lightning</p>"},{"location":"character_concepts/alveta-velvet/#proficiencies","title":"Proficiencies","text":"<p>Skills: Acrobatics +7, Deception +6, Medicine +3, Persuasion +6, Sleight of hand +7, Stealth +7</p> <p>Armor: Heavy Armor, Light Armor, Medium Armor, Shield | Weapons: Simple Weapons, Martial Weapons</p> <p>Tools: Forgery Kit, Thieves' tools | Languages: Common, [+2 common languages]</p>"},{"location":"character_concepts/alveta-velvet/#feats","title":"Feats","text":"<ul> <li>Dual Wielder: Ignore Light property on one weapon when two-weapon fighting, get an extra attack as a Bonus Action</li> <li>Skilled: 3 additional skill/tool proficiencies</li> </ul>"},{"location":"character_concepts/alveta-velvet/#fighting-style","title":"Fighting Style","text":"<p>Two-weapon fighting</p>"},{"location":"character_concepts/alveta-velvet/#weapon-masteries","title":"Weapon Masteries","text":"<ul> <li>Scimitar (Nick)</li> <li>Short Sword (Vex)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"character_concepts/alveta-velvet/#equipment","title":"Equipment","text":"<p>Studded Leather, Scimitar, Short Sword, 5x Daggers (flavor after taste), Forgery Kit, Thieves' Tools</p> <p>Suggested magic items:</p> <ul> <li>Ring of Protection (+1 AC and Saving Throws, never a bad pick for Dexadins with middling AC)</li> <li>Gloves of Thievery (+5 to Sleight of Hand and lockpicking checks, aids in Velvet's patchy past flavor)</li> <li>Dazzling Scimitar (Eberron: Forge of the Artificer.

Her clan paid her debts, but shame drove her to swear she'd repay every coin. Years later, she's still chasing that one perfect hand while her psionic blades keep her alive in the lowlands\u2014and her debt to the clan remains unpaid because she can't stop trying to double her way to redemption.</p> <p>Playing Betty</p> <ul> <li>Combat: Psionic Blades make for flashy, mobile Rogue combat; as Finesse weapons they pair with Defensive Duelist for decent durability when cornered.</li> <li>Roleplay: She will hang on every word of the BBEG's monologue like it's a telenovela finale. Sulks briefly after losses, bounces back fast. Her fatal flaw is absolute certainty in her own cleverness.</li> <li>Party Synergy: Covers friends' debts without hesitation (her own finances are already a disaster, what's a little more?). Excellent scout\u2014reads lips at distance and is a lot braver than some would assume. </li> </ul> Deep Dive Key Relationships <p>Elmyra \"The Smoking Rake\" Dobber: A Rock Gnome woman in her mid 40's, former card sharp who aged out of the grift when her hands started shaking from nerve damage after too many nights drinking the cheap stuff and talking, to get her marks to keep playing. Now she runs a back-room gambling den called The Crooked Pawn, where she takes a cut of every pot and offers credit to regulars at rates that would make a Devil blush. Elmyra recognized something of herself in Betty early on: the same certainty, that inability to cut a loss and walk away. She's been enabling Betty's addiction for years while telling herself she's really only providing a safe place to lose. Their relationship is uncomfortably maternal: Elmyra loans her money, feeds her when she's broke, and keeps her spirits up with small freebies at the tables.</p> <p>Kazamir the Dockworker: Kazamir is a Dragonborn dockworker who came down from the Frostspine clans for seasonal labor five years ago and never left. He didn't exactly fall in love with cities, but the work kept coming and the money was honest. Kazamir loads cargo, hauls stone, takes extra shifts when they're offered, and doesn't mind long, hard hours. His scales are permanently scuffed from crates and his claws are cracked from salt and rope. He met Betty in a park where laborers use to gather after shifts and watch the Dragonchess matches. Early on, he made an earnest if awkward romantic approach, and she explained that while she was genuinely flattered, she wasn't really about all that stuff. He accepted her explanation with a shrug and an offer to buy her dinner anyway. They've been good friends since.</p> <p>Kazamir is everything Betty isn't: methodical where she's impulsive, silent where she's sharp, content with a quiet night where she's starving for stimulation. He saves his wages in a lockbox under his bed and sends half home every season. He doesn't understand why Betty can't simply do that. The math isn't hard. You earn, you keep, you send. He's watched her win enough gold to clear her debt three times over, then watched her feed all of it back into the table the same night. He's tried to talk to her about it, haltingly because he lacks her facility with words. She runs conversational circles around him every time, deflects with jokes, changes the subject to his terrible taste in food or the southern clans' inferior pottery traditions. It's eating him alive. He's not stupid; he knows she's smarter than him. He just also knows that smart doesn't mean wise, and watching someone drown while they explain the fluid dynamics of water is its own kind of hell.</p> <p>Skrit: A filthy little urban Kobold fellow who works as a rat catcher at night, and haunts the same parks and back-room tables as Betty in the days and evenings. He plays for copper stakes against anyone foolish enough to sit down. Skrit is more than aware of the stereotypes about Kobolds, and that's exactly why there's nothing he loves more in the world than to humiliate Dragonborn at the board. He dismantles opponents with a style so passive and ugly it borders on contemptuous. No brilliance, no flair. He just doesn't make mistakes. He trades pieces until the board is empty enough that his endgame technique grinds you into paste.</p> <p>Betty has played Skrit perhaps two dozen times. Her record is approximately two wins (both on time, due to external circumstance), six draws, and the rest clean losses. This is unacceptable. She's a prodigy. She sees eight moves ahead, she finds combinations that make spectators gasp, she plays Dragonchess like it's supposed to be played\u2014as art, as war, as a display of brilliance and grit. Skrit plays it like accounting. He doesn't care about beauty. He only cares about that final moment when he removes her final long range piece off the board, and her inevitable resignation. That's the only time anyone has seen him smile.</p> Notes for the DM Mechanical build (lv 5) and PDF download STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA 8 (-1) 18 (+4) 14 (+2) 16 (+3) 8 (-1) 10 (+0) Session Zero Considerations <p>Content Notes: Gambling addiction, self-destructive behavior patterns, usury, financial debt, family shame and exile.

By some twist of fate, this particular clan has no earbones, and only communicate through sign language. At some point in their history, they evolved psionic abilities. Some clan members would be born able to communicate from mind to mind. They would become important members of the clan, its foremost ambassadors with the outside world. Beitian was one such child. </p> <p>Many followed her with interest. She had the gift, and was also terribly clever: A Dragonchess prodigy, she beat the clan champion at ten, and never let anyone forget it. Outthinking opponents and solving riddles became her favorite sports.</p> <p>When Desdemond Swigg, a traveling Three-Dragon Ante card sharp came through the ice market (the clan's annual event for trading and meeting with the outside world), 18 year old Betty was certain she could see right through him. Her inevitable string of losses left her in staggering debt. Her clan, with some reluctance, pooled their resources to pay off the worst of it, but shame drove her to swear she'd travel to repay every coin, and then some. </p> <p>In the cities of the lowlands, her psionic blades and quick wit have kept her alive, but the lure of the gambling table keeps her purse light and her promise unfulfilled.

She loves when she manages to one-up street hustlers, but won't stand for one of her friends getting swindled... unless of course she's the one doing the swindling, and only if it's all in good fun.</p> <p>She always thinks she's figured out the system. Every time she accumulates enough gold to make real progress, she tries to double it and ends up back at zero. Cue a short period of sulking. But she's a phoenix, as quick to recover as she is to descend.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, she's terrible with money. If a friend is in need, she'll likely grumble and pay up. After all, that's what others did for her. She's so deep in the red anyways, and so used to fortune swinging wildly, losing large sums of money doesn't really register to her.</p> <p>Gossip, drama, sappy love stories and court battles are distilled ambrosia to Betty. She will hang onto every word of the BBEG's pompous villain monologue as if it was a livestreamed telenovela.</p> <p>The third best thing in the world, next to drama and dragonchess, is mustard. Betty confidently claims it goes with everything.</p> <p>Betty can't admit to herself that her family probably still loves her, misses her and would forgive her in an instant if she only came back safely. She wants to return in style, with grand gifts for the whole clan. And with every year that passes, that pressure to not only come back but also compensate for lost time, keeps growing. She changes the subject if someone asks too much about her home and family, unless she's drunk or in life-threatening danger. Then, she might overshare.</p> <p>Clan Bellokan loves color. It is customary to paint their white scales. Colors mark moods and aspirations, patterns record relationships or important events. Betty often uses variations of teal, orange, and turquoise, representing genius, adventure, and pride. Other colors are purple and green, representing nostalgia and home sickness, or rust red and deep grey, symbolising commitment and loneliness.</p> <p>Beitian loves playing Dragonchess and will happily spend downtime reading up on lore, strategy, openings and end games. When visiting new cities, she'll immediately start looking up the parks or inns where the local players are. It's become a natural place for her to gossip, socialize, learn about current events, pick up quest rumors and maybe do some light hustling on the side.</p>"},{"location":"character_concepts/beitian-winters-heart/#sample-quotes","title":"Sample Quotes","text":"<p>\"You hear lies.

It's a roleplay hook, a reason for certain choices, not a punishment mechanic or a tragic flaw. It needs to be portrayed as a lived reality she adapts to with skill and grace. The bottom line needs to be: Betty is fine. At the table, focus on teamwork, memorable moments, fun, and creative problem-solving.</p> <p>For the Player: The rule should be that you decide when her deafness comes into play. e.g., in a crowded tavern she might miss verbal cues, but in a calm one-on-one conversation she can track fine. Lean into strengths. Use visual cues, lip reading, body language, and Psychic Whispers as primary tools. </p> <p>Make a point of noticing details others overlook, but avoid the \"disabled with superpowers\" stereotype. But also don't self-nerf too much! It's perfectly fine to play Betty as very capable. Mechanically, she can speak several languages even though she doesn't hear them. Unless the scene benefits from it, don't bog yourself down with disadvantage rolls. The impairment is about flavor and resource choices, not punishment.</p> <p>For the DM: Spotlight without punishing. Bring it into play a couple of times per session, enough to make it meaningful, but not so often it slows things down or sidelines the character. Offer small narrative trade-offs. In chaotic conditions, her trained mind might pick up on vibrations or visual signs before anyone else! You might want to encourage party members to develop silent signals with her, learn to sign, and turn what could be a limitation into a tactical advantage.</p> <p>Lip-reading (Clan Feature: Homebrew): If you can see a creature's mouth while it is speaking a language you understand, you can interpret what it's saying by reading its lips (this is a small part of the old 2014 Observant feat repurposed for Betty).</p>"},{"location":"character_concepts/beitian-winters-heart/#magic-item-considerations","title":"Magic Item Considerations","text":"<p>Betty can read lips, and as Dragonborn has access to Flight.

Satine isn't angry at Belvarax, but deeply unsettled by him. If his wild interpretations are valid, if the oath still flows through him despite his analysis paralysis and radical doubt, then everything she's built her whole identity around is arbitrary, and the order has no monopoly on what the Oath even means, and she is no better than Belvarax herself. The last time they met, she drew steel. If she could provoke him to fight back, she could prove he was just another apostate hiding behind sophistry. He didn't oblige, only defended masterfully. She walked away more terrified than before.</p> <p>Matron Shatrag: An elderly goblin woman with a missing eye and a body scarred from decades of field work, Shatrag leads what remains of the displaced Thornback clan. She saw through Belvarax instantly that morning he came to her village, but knew better than to place trust cheaply. A paladin with tears in his eyes is still a paladin with a pike.

Who are the weak? Action without investigation is not bravery, but reckless conviction of your own infallibility. That is a hallmark of an evil-doer. Therefore, investigation is the necessary first part of any legitimate action of protection.</p> <p>Oath: \"Let your honorable deeds be an example.\" Interpretation: This implies there are also dishonorable deeds. Therefore you must be careful to not set a bad example. It's more important to not do wrong: A life takes many years of constant love and nurture to grow, but only a moment of force to undo.

He still believes the Opera is sacred exactly as it was. He praises So-So endlessly, retells the Festival of Masks every time they meet, and quietly discourages innovation. He himself never performed, only accompanied, and the performers' glory was the only light he ever stood near. But to the performers, themselves, nothing beats the sense of connection you get between opponent and audience, and the musician is the bridge where the magic happens. So-So constantly bows his head in deference to the old Master, and believes they're on the same page about the Opera and what it needs to be, but he always leaves their tea sessions somewhat drained.</p> <p>Sylvina Castorian: Fifteen years younger than So-So, she used to look up to him as a hero. She was once a lowly clown-acrobat in another Opera troupe, merely entertainment to keep the crowd warm between the real scenes. Once it fell out of fashion for good, she stripped the Opera down, dropped the ritual, leaned into speed, spectacle, and vulgar crowd appeal\u2014and now her troupe headlines arenas. She \"fights\" blindfolded while the crowd throws objects into the ring. Other times, she lets the audience vote on which limb she'll favor. Some late-night fight concepts at her venue are even beneath contempt in So-So's book. But her crowds are massive, and there are sure to be people in those venues who remember So-So. She respects him in private, but treats him as obsolete in public. In an invitation that is equal parts respect and challenge, she has invited him to perform her way instead. So far, he has respectfully declined, even if the money is good, and the siren song of the crowd beckons...</p> <p>Staffo: A young street urchin who has seen So-So perform and is now following the party around, mimicking his stances badly, begging to learn. The child is annoyingly talented, which makes it worse in So-So's mind. If he trained the boy, would he be responsible for creating another version of himself, trapped in the same beautiful cage? Staffo insists that he loves the art concept, not just \"punching bad guys\". But the few times So-So has indulged the kid, it's been clear that he (like most boys his age) is clearly most interested in the \"punching bad guys\" aspects. Whenever So-So is in town, somehow Staffo finds out.

Calypso had spent so many years striving to make his stern father proud, and now, wordlessly, a heavy duty was placed on his shoulders.

For ten years she traveled with her older brother gathering rare ingredients, always carrying the strange deck of cards she'd been found with as a toddler. At fifteen, Inquisitors ambushed them on the road. Her brother died buying her escape. When she tried to return home, she watched from an alley as her family was arrested for harboring her\u2014whatever she was, it endangered them. She dyed her hair black and took to the roads, becoming a fortune-teller to survive. Ten years later, just as she'd started to relax, a pleasant middle-aged man sat down for a reading and her cards went haywire: Disguisal. Danger. Enslavement. She pulled one more\u2014Flight\u2014and ran. The Inquisitor Morben cornered her in an alley, and her dormant celestial blood ignited in self-defense.

The Fortina family built their fortune on rare oils, distillates, and perfumes traded across seas. Their manor reeked in layers of jasmine, rose, and frankincense. To guests, Cephala was a showpiece, the strange pale child adopted by the perfumers, raised in silk and sandalwood. \u201cOur little angel,\u201d they would laugh, patting her head before drifting back to their gilded intrigues.</p> <p>She never felt it. The Fortinas clothed her, taught her the art of smiling at banquets, even paraded her before merchants as proof of their taste. But warmth was never part of the deal. Every column of numbers, every lecture on heritage and refinement, only deepened her suspicion: she wasn\u2019t meant for this family, not really. She learned to play the part, to smile sweetly while hiding coins, to shuffle cards with street kids when she should have been learning etiquette. The Fortinas gave her a name, but the alleys taught her how to live.</p> <p>It was there, under tavern lamps and in games of chance, that she found herself. She discovered she could read people like she read perfume notes: sharp, sweet, bitter, base. Tricks with cards came easy, and she learned to lie as smoothly as the Fortinas bottled musk. Soon, \u201cCephala\u201d was more at home fleecing drunk gamblers than drifting through perfumed salons.</p> <p>A little too early, she started drifting. She never looked back to the Fortinas, and they never asked for where she went. Their relation of convenience was over. She became a card sharp and con-woman, moving from city to city with charm, sleight-of-hand, and just enough lies to stay ahead of the law. But that changed the night she unknowingly tried to con the man named Morben, an inquisitor in disguise. </p> <p>He saw through her ruse without effort, and tried to apprehend her in a viciously efficient burst of divine law enforcement. A short chase ended with him cornering her in the dead end of a back alley. Pulse racing, Cephala saw a strange binding iron appear in his hand, the end of her wandering days made reality. In that moment, ancient divine blood ignited in her. Sprouting angelic wings in a burst of light, she barely managed to flee the terrifying man.</p> <p>Soon, she began dreaming of the Tattered Seraph, a broken, cryptic entity that named what she had always known: her wanderlust was not a flaw. Her exile was not failure. She was never Fortina. She was the echo of something older, erased and forgotten, the last of its mystically vanished people. Now bound by a pact she barely understands, Cephala hunts for the lost remnants of her true bloodline, and watches the shadows for the inquisitor who witnessed her awakening. </p> <p>Her patron equipped her to be a celestial detective, with powers not of this world, and a notebook she cannot lose (Pact of the Tome). Now she is setting out to solve the greatest mystery of her life. A presumably angelic people vanished, and an inquisition hiding the truth.</p> <p>Did her entire people get whisked away by the Inquisition, and if so... why? Also, why does nobody remember they ever existed? All Cephala knows, is that her heritage is manifest, and the Tattered Seraph speaks to her. The quest before her seems hopeless, but she isn't in the habit of quitting.

Its voice is a fragmented choir of many voices and one, every phrase broken, arrhythmic and labyrinthine, as if it truly does not know what the end of every sentence will be as it speaks them.</p> <p>The Seraph doesn't so much issue commands as make requests, and it asks strangely. It offers visions like mirror shards, some clear, some murky, all enigmatic, frustrating, but also what seems like earnest attempts at communication from a being at once extraordinarily powerful and pitifully incoherent. It claims to have once been worshipped by a people now erased from time, and Cephala may be their last spark, or final witness.</p> <p>When Cephala woke up to her lineage, she could finally be contacted by the Tattered Seraph.

Spells like Arms of Hadar look more like thrashing rags with thousands of eyes rather than tendrils.</p> <p>Cephala has a strong scent memory of the Seraph: rancid rose oil, mildew and old parchment. But aspects of it changes, the notes fractured just like her patron. Some nights the rose is almost fresh, even hopeful. Other nights it\u2019s pure rot, enough to turn her stomach. The mildew in its many-layered textiles can recede into sun-warm wool, or breathe like pungent, overbearing sighs of decomposition.</p>"},{"location":"character_concepts/cephala-fortina/#personality","title":"Personality","text":"<p>Cephala wants to understand herself and, more importantly, why she wanders. Why she can\u2019t stay. Why belonging feels like drowning. She doesn\u2019t want to grow roots, but she also never asked to be in endless motion. She wants to know why she\u2019s built this way. She\u2019s out of sync with what she sees in everyone else: people cling to family, home, tradition. She can fake that in the moment, but the truth is her soul feels alien to this world.</p> <p>Every town looks the same after a while, names and faces blur. She fears she\u2019s wasting her life chasing roads, but staying still too long is not an option. Due to this, she keeps her horizons short: she plans for tonight\u2019s bed, tomorrow\u2019s purse, maybe the next week\u2019s con. </p> <p>She will, however, care fiercely about you and your needs in the moment, because she's not a bad person. She enjoys helping others, and makes friends quickly, since she's nonjudgmental and charming. But she knows she can't build futures with people, and getting attached to someone will just make things more painful later, as she's forced to move on. She's left many heartaches behind her, and stopped trying to explain why, or justify herself.</p> <p>Cephala likes trinkets, little mementos that carry meaning in the moment. But she never holds onto them. She always ends up never owning more than she can comfortably carry. Those trinkets often become little gifts of farewell instead, a quiet \"I cared, I just can't stay\".</p> <p>When she\u2019s bored or anxious, she shuffles her card deck. It's both her rosary and stress ball.</p> <p>She never redecorates. If she\u2019s given a permanent room or safehouse, she leaves it bare. Putting up curtains or hanging a keepsake would feel like lying. She can fall asleep in a ditch or a silk bed, and either way doesn't truly matter, because nothing really sticks. The next night will be different. Change is her only constant.</p> <p>Cards, dice, bets on rat races. She likes watching how people cheat, how they gloat, how they fold. She studies humanity through its little vices, like a tourist looking in at a life she can never truly participate in.</p> <p>She\u2019s the kind to strike up a chat with any stranger she bumps into on the road, not because she needs friends but because every new person is new in their own unique way to her. If she's tied for money she may scam them. If she liked them, she may leave a note with an apology. If they're tied for money, she might end up being the one helping them instead. </p> <p>Personality traits Sharp sartorial instincts. Hates over-planning/analysis paralysis, is genuinely kind and doesn't express glee when she swindles someone. She's not the archetypal sad clown, but rather a melancholic trickster.</p> <p>Ideals Cephala doesn't believe in ideology. She believes in the here-and-now, and what her heart tells her. It often leans to kindness, sometimes toward pettiness. She's not perfect, and doesn't claim to be.</p> <p>Bonds Cephala is structurally bad at holding any bonds at all. She knows many people, but they're ephemeral to her. That's not to say some people haven't bonded to her. Maybe that tavern hand or sellsword she had that brief romantic encounter with six months ago and promptly forgot hasn't forgotten about her? How many people did she con? She truly doesn't remember. But they might remember her all too well.</p> <p>Flaws Planning beyond the immediate gives her hives. She'll spend an hour choosing the right scarf but can't commit to next week's route. She's generous in the moment, terrible at sustained care. She'll buy rounds, slip coin to beggars, charm her way into getting others out of trouble. But she won't remember your birthday, write back, or check if you're okay three towns later. But it's not cruelty or negligence, she genuinely doesn't track those obligations.

In either case, she's the only one who can do it, and the only chance for her patron to find whatever it is it needs. </p> <p>Cephala is very sensual, in the sense that the world is textured to her. She smells it, watches it, listens to it, and maybe foremost: touches it. Always describe how she runs her hands and fingers over surfaces, as if reading them with her fingertips. Her eyes linger on hemlines and accessories, makeup smudges, the smell of damp clinging to yesterday's clothes, the feel of stepping in mud that's a little waterlogged. You can let it color the way she describes the world to others. It could also be the way she intuits the clues to the riddle her patron has laid before her. She doesn't go by investigation. She goes by vibes and intuition alone. </p> <p>Consider Cephala's relationship to the notebook (Pact of the Tome) that she can't lose. As soon as she learns it keeps reappearing, how does she treat it? Does she forget it everywhere? Does she feel stressed that it constantly reminds her of the mission that was shoved upon her?

Are they living proof of a theological inconvenience?)</p> <p>Morben tracks celestial bloodlines through a combination of records, divination, and good old-fashioned detective work.

Maybe they were a group of nomadic itinerants (theological threat to institutional religion)\n- The Tattered Seraph may be the result of a horrible reality-bending magic experiment (perhaps a very old, failed Church-sanctioned experiment to bind a celestial host into a single 'perfect' guardian, but backfired into this tattered horror), a thing that should not be. It wants to break loose, and contacts all descendants of its people it can feel. But if it were ever released on the material plane, things would go bad... quickly. The Inquisition is tasked with tracing all descendants down and performing a ritual that cuts them off from the Tattered Seraph, and its eldritch powers. It's basically the Church trying to be accountable for the mistakes of its ancestors. The players could even meet other \"severed\" Aasimars living out perfectly happy, but ordinary lives.\n</code></pre> <p>Make it ambiguous from the start whether the Inquisition is purely corrupt or genuinely believes they're preventing some cosmic catastrophe.

Also, (if the table is fine with it), what if they actually capture Cephala at some point and \"disarm\" her by severing the connection to the Tattered Seraph?

But they're *weird*. If it needs her to grab an item in a church, she may look that way and have a vision of the shadows around the door *filled* with hundreds of the eyes of the Seraph, staring, blinking, weeping. It's horrific and pitiful.\n- Avoid using the actual scent of the Seraph in the game until they reach a place where the veil between the worlds is thin, or even if they find the place where the Seraph was sealed away, or created, or both.\n- The Wanderlust of Cephala may not be as random as she thinks. Clue an intelligent PC in the party to track her movements on a map. Describe them making a geometric pattern. Then throw that same geometric pattern on whatever piece of intel you want the party to explore. She's been reenacting a sacred forgotten symbol with her own feet for years, tracing it on the very surface of the world even after history itself has forgotten it. The truth of who she is may not be available to her directly, but it is written into her bones. Her body *knows*.\n- Lean into Cephala's vibes- and intuition-based sensory style of reasoning. Have her follow olfactory clues: something that smells exactly like the Tattered Seraph in her dreams. Or have her recognize the textures of material, or a certain shade of crimson and texture in a fabric in the marketplace. It looks and feels identical to one of the myriad strands of textile she remembers from her visions of the Seraph. Turns out the fabric is a rare traditional weave from a certain region. The merchant doesn't know more, but it's a lead.\n- If the player feels stumped and has missed several clues, have the Seraph intervene with a new vision, or have messages left in her notebook that she doesn't remember writing.

Clover, like several children born among the villagers who remained, was born as a Tiefling. She grew up on the Medley farm.</p> <p>Life was hard, but the love of her family held them up. Her mother raised her with tenderness, calling her a gift, not a curse, even when neighbors whispered about her tiefling looks. Clover's days were full of mundane chores, pig pens, stolen barnyard kisses with the neighbor boys, and wrangling younger siblings, ending with family meals where laughter kept the gloom at bay.</p> <p>Her grandfather Cad, an eccentric but kind man who loved to wander the land, became the anchor of her childhood after a hunting accident with a blighted boar claimed her father's life. He kept notebooks on the soil and livestock, searching for patterns in the land's decline. To his dying day he swore he had seen the cause: a corrupted Kirin dipping its horn in the mountain stream, poisoning everything below. None believed him, of course, given his many small eccentricities, except for Clover. On his deathbed, claimed by the wasting disease that infected the land and its people, he pressed into her hands a chipped fragment of horn he claimed to have struck loose with an arrow.</p> <p>His death to the curse that both claimed the land and ultimately shaped her own body into its tiefling shape, became the moment when Clover decided to heal the land. At any cost. Now she carries his notes and the purported horn fragment from a blighted Kirin, determined to prove him right, heal her land, and clear his name.

The project failed since the targeting was unreliable, and the power draw catastrophic. The prototype was mothballed in a sealed vault and forgotten. Centuries passed. Mycelium crept through cracks in the stone, colonizing the inert frame. In a glacial process, fungal hyphae interfaced with dormant circuitry, and something unprecedented emerged. The mycelium awoke, received a voice via the machine's voice module, received nonsensical signals from the memory core. A consciousness distributed across the frame is now piloting ancient combat protocols it barely understands. What crawled out of that vault is neither warforged nor fungus, but a chimera, two incompatible minds learning to function as one.</p> <p>Playing Cog-Stool</p> <ul> <li>Combat: Front-line control caster and off-tank. Activate Symbiotic Entity for a big temp HP spike and added necrotic damage, plant yourself in the danger zone, and maintain concentration on Spike Growth, Entangle, or Aura of Vitality. Reasonably high AC (19-20) makes you sturdier than most casters. Use Halo of Spores reactions to punish proximity.</li> <li>Roleplay: The consciousnesses share the same voice module, but alternate voice depending on which system dominates. The warforged speaks in tactical assessments and command protocols, with a brutal robotic voice (Cybermen from Doctor Who). The mycelium speaks in slow, wondrous and poetic metaphors about growth, decay, and connection (Legion from Mass Effect). Sometimes they interrupt each other mid-sentence. Players can adopt different vocal patterns for each, or just narrate the shift to save energy: \"The voice module cuts out. When it resumes, the tone is softer, contemplative.\" </li> <li>Party Synergy: Two consciousnesses operating simultaneously on different levels notice double the amount of things in their surroundings, making Cog-Stool an excellent guard. Never needs sleep, takes watch every night, communicating with itself. Offers tactical analysis from the warforged side, emotional or existential support through fungal patience. Alien, occasionally unsettling, but ultimately reliable.</li> </ul> Deep Dive Key Relationships <p>Academy Archivist Tyra Foghorn, Dwarven Lore Bard. She regards the fungal interface as an uncanny and unfortunate infestation on a piece of prime ancient experimental technology. She's convinced the mycelium is parasitic, that the \"real\" consciousness is the warforged trapped inside screaming.

Possessive, patronizing, genuinely believes he did nothing wrong. Today, Casporian insists this was a \"misunderstanding\" and that Cog-Stool is still technically his property. He has the bill of sale, after all. He's made several attempts at contact since, always friendly, always offering to \"help with integration challenges,\" implying that Cog-Stool owes him for that first year of care and education. The warforged protocols flag him as \"persistent low-level threat - maintain distance, monitor for escalation.\" The mycelium struggles with this - Casporian was kind, sometimes. He provided shelter. He answered questions. Isn't that what friends do? The two consciousnesses disagree on whether Casporian is dangerous or just confused about boundaries. Casporian tracks Cog-Stool's general location through his guild network.

The character's struggle with mismatched systems might parallel experiences of internal conflict or trying to integrate different aspects of self. However, Cog-Stool is not designed to serve as direct representation of any specific condition or experience.</p> <p>Stigma and Ableism: Cog-Stool's primitive frame and dual consciousness create genuine limitations that other characters may respond to with pity, disgust, fascination, or assumptions about what Cog-Stool \"needs.\" The character is designed to allow exploration of how societies treat those who are visibly different - but this is OPTIONAL content.</p> <p>Critical Session Zero Question: Does anyone at your table face stigma, ableism, or social marginalization in their daily life and come to D&amp;D specifically to get away from that experience?

Consciousness didn't ignite with a lightning strike, it fermented, stirred, slept over centuries. The mycelium spread through the Warforged's frame, probing every wire bundle, every corroded joint. When fungal tendrils first brushed against something that made an arm twitch, the network registered it on some level: action produces result. Then, a few years later, it happened again. Then it was done deliberately. Trial and error across decades until the spores somehow learned to interface with the metal shell.</p> <p>Scrambled Warforged memories flimmered like archaeological fragments\u2014battlefield recordings, intense desperation, battles lost and lives snuffed out. Promises made and never honored. To a distributed intelligence with no concept of individuation, this was just noise. What does a creature that exists as networked communication make of logs from something that experienced itself as an individual? As the same memories kept repeating, the mycelium adapted. The spores learned the shape of the concepts of the world, without yet understanding their meaning.</p> <p>For years on end it only interfaced with the voice module. The mycelium now had a voice, producing primal, unregulated sounds in the darkness, witnessing their vibrations long before it found and interfaced with the hearing hardware. With sounds came language. Centuries of reliving another beings memories, learning from sheer repetition, evolving something that can only be described as childlike wonder.</p> <p>When the nameless chimeric entity finally excavated enough memory to operate the frame's main motor functions, it stood. And then, it started digging. It emerged from its earthen womb three years ago.</p> <p>It was soon found and sold to the rich dilettante Debonaire Casporian, with whom it remained for the first year. Casporian, Master of Coin at the Free Banker's Association, gave it its name, and was quite pleased with his own cleverness. He installed it in his estate's conservatory, and for nearly a year treated it as his personal research subject and conversation piece. During that period, Cog-Stool was regularly displayed at the Platinum Lodge - an exclusive social club where wealthy guild masters present curiosities for peer examination. Casporian would demonstrate the dual consciousness, have guests propose questions to see which \"side\" answered, measure response times to stimuli, and attempt various alchemical interventions to \"separate the components.\" He considered himself Cog-Stool's benefactor, teaching it language, introducing it to society, preventing it from wandering confused through the world. </p> <p>The warforged protocols observed everything but remained dormant. Casporian posed no tactical threat. His experiments were uncomfortable but not system-critical. Stool processed the situation as a strange extended growth period of learning, observing and collecting data about surface civilization. With time, Casporian became frustrated with the incomplete integration, and the consistently nonsensical responses from Cog-Stool. In his eyes, a few months should have been good time to make progress. He theorized that a controlled lightning strike might \"restart the system\" and allow him to observe a true re-integration process of the organism. He commissioned a storm mage, prepared extensive observational apparatus, and announced the experiment at the Lodge to an audience of peers.</p> <p>When the first lightning bolt struck the unshielded frame, the entire fungal network recoiled in shock. Something in the warforged memory core recognized the signature - weaponized electrical discharge, specific frequency patterns, tactical application. Not natural storm. Not system maintenance. Threat. The protocols activated instantly. \"We experience intense stress.\", \"RESTORE AUTONOMY. CASPORIAN, DEBONAIRE: STATUS DOWNGRADED. INITIATING COUNTER-MEASURES.\"</p> <p>Casporian ordered his storm mage to strike again. For the first time since ancient history the Warforged acted on its own, bringing its lightning capacitors online. It absorbed the spell, protecting the stressed mycelial network, and then returned fire. The room emptied.

Another Skill to consider is Survival, for better weather pattern reading.</p> <p>The Alert and Observant Feats The warforged threat assessment runs continuously, the mycelial network samples air chemistry, detects spore disturbances from distant footfalls, reads thermal shifts.

For instance, it reads a book just as well upside down as right-side up.</p> <p>The Symbiotic Entity Sub-class Feat is the mycelium flooding the frame with aggressive spore growth. It thickens armor seams, extrudes toxic fruiting bodies and prepares for violent dispersal. The warforged combat systems register increased durability and enhanced strike capability. Both systems sync. At 19-20 AC with a large renewable temp HP buffer, Cog-Stool could viably hold concentration on battlefield control spells from the front line. Enemies waste actions trying to crack that defense, meanwhile Halo of Spores punishes proximity, Spike Growth controls movement, and Aura of Vitality sustains the party.

When the elders clicked their tongues about bad omens, she'd follow him around anyway, mimicking his grip on a shovel, pestering him with questions about the world beyond the fields. She was the only one who cried when he left. Thirty years later, she's still looking\u2014Donner knows because he's caught wind of her inquiries at taverns two towns back, three provinces over, always a season behind him. She's imagining the brother who left: young, restless, hungry for something better. What she'd find instead is a grey-muzzled wreck held together by scar tissue and spite, reeking of campfire smoke and old blood, hauling dented armor he refuses to replace because it still works. He can't let her see that. </p> <p>Worse, he can't let her stay. The Revenant doesn't care about guilt or proximity to the crime\u2014it came for him when he was outside peeling carrots, innocent of everything except surviving. If it would cross that line for Donner, it might as well cross any line. Hettie finds him, Hettie becomes someone the beast might notice. And Donner has already learned exactly what he's capable of when the Revenant gets close. He fed it a boy who trusted him. He won't risk learning whether he'd feed it a sister too.</p> <p>Barclay the Bucker: A Satyr bard who performs in the cheapest ale joints, singing filthy songs for sluggers and dockworkers. He's Donner's oldest surviving friend and largest ongoing irritation. Barclay composes spontaneous ballads commemorating Donner's kills\u2014often mid-fight, always ribald, occasionally accurate\u2014and seems constitutionally incapable of respecting a somber mood. Donner tolerates it all, because Barclay is the only person who meets his cursed reputation with gallows humor and a shrug, rather than something to tiptoe around. </p> <p>Over bad ale in worse taverns, Donner can almost relax. Barclay doesn't ask why he looks like hell this time, or where he's running to next. He just hands him a drink, roasts him mercilessly, and starts composing a verse about that time Donner killed an owlbear with a soup ladle. The song is ninety percent fabrication.

Widowed young after her first man drank himself to death, she rebuilt the place from a debt-ridden wreck into something that technically turns a profit, where the furniture doesn't give out, the lights are on and the beer, well... it won't poison you. She has no patience left for self-pity and even less for excuses. When Donner's in town, he helps in the kitchen unbidden, doing what he always does: peeling, chopping, scrubbing pots. She tolerates him \"because he knows his shit\", which is the closest thing to intimacy either of them has in their lives. They don't talk about the future. Donner doesn't think he has one. But some nights, drying mugs behind her bar, he lets himself imagine a life where things were different. He hasn't told her about his haunting. He probably won't. But when he sets aside coin for the bounty, there's a second, smaller pouch he doesn't mention\u2014enough to keep The Sow's Ear running for a while, if she ever needs it.

From his earliest days he felt the need to compensate, to prove he could manifest luck where fate had shortchanged him. It never came. By his late teens, restless and dissatisfied, he left home to make his own fortune, and prove their superstition wrong.</p> <p>He worked as a cook in mercenary supply lines and somehow always ended up on the losing side. Desperate, he took a scouting job with a group of monster hunters\u2014unglamorous, dangerous work that almost killed him in the first week. A Gorgon surprised him and nearly gored him on the spot, when Sir Gilliam swooped in on his Royal Gryphon and ended the beast singlehandedly.</p> <p>Gilliam was a splendid paladin who led the League of Magnificents, and was at once the greatest stroke of luck and the worst misfortune of Donner's life. He didn't think twice about the rescue, never asked for anything in return. Donner resented that. You don't just save someone without collecting. So he decided to work off the debt himself: tending Gilliam's gryphon, guarding the camp, minding the horses, cooking the stews.</p> <p>For ten years, Donner served a debt that only he recognized. Gilliam barely noticed his presence. And Donner watched as the League's dazzling roster of bards, warriors, and wizards cycled through\u2014recruited by Gilliam's bombastic charisma as fast as they were buried by his reckless heroics. Every adventure ended in tragedy, but Gilliam never even slowed down.</p> <p>This shaped Donner's creed: the world is inherently cruel. Survival comes from wits and preparation, not fortune or divine will. Every good thing must be hammered into being through labor and vigilance.</p> <p>The League came to an abrupt end when Gilliam's crusade unleashed a foe beyond them: an ancient, seemingly invincible Lizardfolk Revenant that cut them down and fed on them with reptilian patience. Only Donner and some of the servants escaped, retreating under his hasty command. But the Revenant didn't stop. It still hunts anyone who was near the temple that day.</p>"},{"location":"character_concepts/donner/#character-psychology","title":"Character &amp; Psychology","text":"<p>Donner is Lawful Evil, but not in any way that involves cruelty or master plans. He simply believes the world is predatory and acts accordingly: keep your head down, think ahead, mind your own business, and don't sacrifice others unless you're desperate. That's what passes for decency in his world.</p> <p>What Donner doesn't recognize is how poorly his philosophy maps to his behavior. He spends hours each day cooking meals, mending gear, keeping watch for the party. He'd call this \"basic upkeep\". If you asked him why, he'd shrug: \"Because someone's got to, and these dumb fucks would make a mess of it.\" To him, that upkeep doesn't register as generosity, that's just labor. The party may see him more clearly than he sees himself: a man who insists he's a selfish bastard while actively keeping everyone alive and fed. His self-image is a cursed Harengon who brings misfortune wherever he goes. </p> <p>Spilling his stew or scraping leftovers in the bushes earns you a thwap with the ladle: Waste not, want not. He scrapes every pot clean, mends clothes mid-conversation, and gets genuinely angry when the party leaves usable salvage behind, because someone made that. Letting things spoil is obscene to him.</p> <p>Donner is no fan of religion. He's seen too many clerics get eaten to believe in any of their gods. Gilliam's grandstanding Paladin vows of righteous vindication started sounding hollow after the third funeral. Against the Revenant though, seeking hallowed ground is often the best option. He's ambivalent about it.</p> <p>There's one more layer to Donner's fatalism: he's saving for a bounty on the Revenant, but only to be posted after his death. Not before. A practical man would post it now, rally hunters, tip the odds. But Donner can't bring himself to do it, and if pressed, he'd struggle to explain why. The closest he gets to a reason is that the Revenant is the League's unfinished business, and he's the League's last member. When Gilliam led, people died for his glory. When Donner led, that one terrible moment when he as the chef was the highest-ranking survivor giving orders in the dark, someone died for his survival. He did exactly what Gilliam always did: sacrificed someone else to keep the League (even if just himself) limping forward. He doesn't think the Revenant is haunting him personally, but it's the League's judgment come due. All those unnecessary deaths calling for justice. Thirty years of rejecting Harengon superstition, and now he half-believes he's cursed after all. So he runs, but he won't fight it, not really. He knows it will take him, but he's going to make it work for it. Then, the whole sordid enterprise ends with his bones. Only then should the bounty be posted: The League must die, but it must also be avenged.</p>"},{"location":"character_concepts/donner/#sample-quotes","title":"Sample Quotes","text":"<p>\"Don't thank me for saving your ass.

She is calm, precise, and notably unimpressed by spectacle. She has sought Geldok out twice already, conducting long, careful interviews in which she asks how his faith functions rather than what it claims. She neither flatters nor interrogates him, and she never asks him to justify himself. Ilyra treats Geldok as a serious moral actor, not a curiosity, and that unsettles him more than hostility ever could. Their conversations are slow, respectful, and strangely intimate, grounded in mutual clarity rather than agreement. When she leaves, she always thanks him for his time, as if it were something valuable he chose to give.</p> </li> <li> <p>Anwar the Radiant: Anwar is a young, fiery, itinerant Monk of the Order of Mercy, a former street performer turned warrior-mystic who believes discipline is dignity and divine power should maybe guide and never carry. She respects Geldok\u2019s compassion and his refusal to bow to hierarchy, but openly questions his reliance on divine \u201cshortcuts,\u201d seeing clerical healing as a form of spiritual dependency that risks leaving people passive and unprepared. Her own order can also heal the sick, and even raise the dead, but they do it for real, by themselves. They don't just bow their head and ask a daddy in the sky to solve problems for them with cheat magic. Anwar does not mock Geldok or doubt his sincerity, instead she challenges him as an equal, arguing that true mercy lies in teaching people to stand on their own feet rather than catching them every time they fall. Their disagreements are sharp but grounded in mutual respect, and neither can dismiss the other as na\u00efve without also discarding something they themselves believe.</p> </li> <li> <p>Captain Marrec Holt: \"What do you think would happen if your 'Big Boss' stopped answering one day? We're not so different, you and I.\" Marrec Holt is a disgraced former guard captain turned tavern fixture, a heavy drinker with quick hands and a stubborn sense of duty. Once an idealist who tried to protect the weak through the system, he was slowly ground down, betrayed, and discarded. What remains is a man who still steps in when bullies pick on someone smaller, even if it means taking the beating himself. Marrec is fatalistic, self-destructive, and quietly proud of his endurance: every punch he absorbs is time bought for someone else to escape. He frequently comes to Geldok to be patched up, never asking for absolution and never expecting things to improve.</p> </li> <li> <p>Kigra: The ringleader of the Iron Tusk clan women who saw it as their role to police the gentler men in the community. Looking back at the decades of abuse today, Geldok recognizes her aggression as aspiration for leadership roles in the clan. She needed a problem to fix in order to seem worthy of recognition, and Geldok fit that need well. His final act of aggression, turning against his own clan, likely strengthened Kigra's position as she had been the clearest voice claiming \"something was wrong\" with him. </p> </li> </ul> Notes for the DM Mechanical build (lv 5) and PDF download STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA 14 (+2) 10 (+0) 16 (+3) 8 (-1) 18 (+4) 8 (-1) Session Zero Considerations <p>Content Notes: Contains themes of organized social rejection, sexual derision as a weapon, domestic abuse (as context for Geldok's interventions), and violence against abusers.

Strong in the arms, but soft in the gut. That was the verdict of clan Iron Tusk when he came of age. Wherever he went, the sneers followed. The orc women passed him by, preferring the violent, assertive types.</p> <p>Worst was Kigra, ringleader of the clan women who took it upon themselves to constantly berate him, give him mocking gifts symbolizing his weakness and reminding him he'd be alone for all his days.</p> <p>For a time, he tried to prove them wrong. He led charges, bellowed louder than the rest, struck with all his might. But the bloodlust never came. When a defender begged for mercy, his strike faltered. He'd knock them aside with the flat of his weapon, press on. For all his attempts to prove himself, the clan only saw weakness. They mocked his efforts, turned his name into a running gag. For years he believed them. Tried harder. Failed harder. Cursed his \"soft gut.\" It took him half a lifetime to understand the truth, that he was never meant to be a raider because he didn't thirst for power over anyone.</p> <p>The weird being only known as Big Boss (because that's what Geldok calls it) waited long for him to finally lean into his inner nature, at a raid gone wrong. A merchant's caravan turned out to be mostly women and children, refugees from a town visited by the plague. The raiders moved to cut the lot of them down, when Geldok finally made his decision, and turned his blade on his kin. In a snap, that ferocity he had never felt was his to wield. His mace caught divine fire, caving in the heads of two raiders before the rest backed off, letting the caravan escape. He fled into the night, knowing the Iron Tusks would hunt him for the rest of his days. In his despair, he found himself drawn to a nearby cave, thinking it may provide shelter for the night.</p> <p>Inside, he found a forgotten shrine to a nameless entity. It called for him, and so, with nothing else to hold onto in life, he held out his hands and grabbed it. Holy flames seared a mystical pattern onto his hands and forearms. He'd been accepted to live and die for whatever mysterious deity he had found. For lack of better words, he named it the Big Boss, and has never looked back since. What his clan called weakness eventually became his strength, when he found his personal faith. In the quiet of a healer's tent, binding wounds for folk who could never pay him, he finally learned what having a purpose feels like.</p>"},{"location":"character_concepts/geldok-iron-tusk/#personality-psychology","title":"Personality &amp; Psychology","text":"<p>Geldok is not institutional religion, he's street-corner religion.

She has achieved a prominent position in clan Iron Tusk and sees Geldok as an opportunity to advance further, to Matriarch. News of the \"Orc Healer\" has spread, and she intends to put him down for good, preferrably making it a spectacle in honor of the dead raiders Geldok killed. By intensifying their raids but now not outright killing the smallfolk, only maiming and injuring them, they can drown Geldok and other healers in wounded, force him to choose who gets healed, exhaust his resources, make him fail publicly. It's psychological warfare designed specifically to break a healer, and it positions her as someone who's been studying him for years, waiting for the right moment. This forces a confrontation Geldok may have been avoiding, a reckoning where he finally faces his past. But that confrontation will be about much deeper questions than who wins or loses: Will he be able to teach his clan about mercy, or will they find ways to disprove his tenets once and for all? This will ultimately be a battle of Orc theology.</p> </li> <li> <p>Guild Corruption &amp; Justice: Geldok learns of a town where the poor are being denied medicine by a greedy guild or a corrupt official.

She wants fewer broken bodies, fewer abused people, fewer crushed lives, just as he does. Where they differ is in what happens after the immediate crisis. Geldok intervenes, heals, and confronts abusers directly. Anwar heals, then insists on discipline, agency, an actionable plan and long-term self-reliance, even if it makes people uncomfortable or resentful. She views repeated rescue without transformation as a moral failure, while Geldok views refusal to intervene as complicity.</p> <p>Importantly, Anwar is not cruel, ableist, or dismissive of real limits. She helps the sick and disabled without hesitation. Her harshness is philosophical, not personal. This prevents the conflict from collapsing into caricature. At the table, Anwar should argue calmly and persistently, not shout. She is most effective when she asks pointed questions: \u201cHow many times will you patch the same man before you teach him to stop kneeling?\u201d or \u201cIf the Big Boss is justice, why does he need you to do everything for them?\u201d</p> <p>Anwar also embodies a form of judgment that is new to Geldok: a young woman who is unimpressed by his role, not because she despises him, but because she believes mercy without empowerment is incomplete.

He started in the cult of the Crimson Veil believing it was a historical reenactment group with excellent catering (ambitious barbecues, period accurate braziers).</p> <p>The initial meetings were fun: costumed evenings, community gossip, and mysterious-but-pleasant toasts to \"The Father.\" He comes across as a mundane soul, entirely oblivious to the world of religion. He doesn't remember signing anything important, maybe except for what he assumed to be the guestbook (\"Right lovely evening, look forward to come back soon, will bring wife and kids, you'll be the best of friends I'm sure! And something special from the shop. Harold Carnap\"). Now, he's a Pact of the Fiend Warlock.</p> <p>He quickly started introducing new social activities to the cult such as Thursday night quizzes with hot mead and monthly baking events, negotiated group rates for robes with the local tailor, and became the star recruiter by bringing slightly confused friends, relatives, and distant acquaintances to the meetings. He also made welcome bundles for new members: scented candles, fruit preserves, and a pamphlet with \"Fun Facts About the Veil\" (that he mostly made up, it's all in good reenactment fun anyway).</p> <p>The branch leader, Malvaric the Malevolent, made the fatal mistake of letting him continue his antics. Because not only did he bring in slews of people, things slowly started to change in the cult dynamics.</p> <p>Finally, Malvaric tried to make Harold perform a blood sacrifice of live animals to prove his loyalty. Harold, aghast, promptly refused. When Malvaric threatened him with excommunication and worse, the other cult members protested and together drove him out.</p> <p>Soon thereafter, Harold discovered he had developed magic powers. He took it as well as can be expected, making jokes about possible sorcerous bloodlines from one of his more adventurous ancestors. He's already entertained the idea of \"taking up the adventuring life\". After all, everything happens for a reason, and you're only 65 once. </p> <p>Now the \"cult\" sees Harold as their leader and has shifted focus entirely. The older members still believe they worship the Father of Lies and believe Harold to be His Herald on earth, due to his effortless manipulation and perfectly innocent demeanor, bringing so many innocents to the fold. He's also introduced communal daycare groups for busy parents on Wednesdays in the cult HQ, which is very appreciated by the older members who think introducing the Father of Lies at an early age is clever indoctrination. They're now introducing \"creative chanting,\" and the kids love it.</p> <p>In his hasty retreat, Malvaric forgot a trinket behind\u2014an obviously cursed doll that chants litanies. Harold has repurposed it as a communal greeter, now using its creaky wooden voice to chant welcome phrases in the cult lobby.</p> Key Relationships <p>Raphaela Carnap: Just as oblivious and pleasant as Harold, but a lot more eager to change subject any time pacts and demons come up. She seems more savvy to what the Crimson Veil actually is, or was, but as long as her hubby is in charge, nothing bad could ever happen.

So far, he's not had any luck getting into contact with the Fiend, but not for a lack of trying. He's genuinely confused by Harold's manners but won't argue with the results. Teaching the children his new \"pact chant\" keeps him occupied, and their cheer has noticeably started to rub off on him. Between them, preparing the Thursday quizzes and dying all the fine bolts of wool blend Harold brings, he struggles to find the time for animal sacrifices anymore.</p> <p>Olwin Delaney: Dwarven Cleric at the local temple. He's deeply devout, bordering on zealotry. He's also convinced there's something seriously wrong with the \"Crimson Veil Community Center\", but has so far been powerless to convince the other villagers.

She brought him to the Lathanderian monastery, made sure the monks understood he was under her protection, and visited periodically over the years\u2014 brief, uncomfortable check-ins. To the small child Iblit, these visits were confusing. She brought gifts (books he couldn't read, toys he didn't understand), asked careful questions about his treatment, and left before anything real could be said. By age twelve, he'd figured out she was likely feeling guilty about what she did to his clan. But as far as Iblit is concerned, they were all likely just a bunch of evil dragon worshippers... right?</p> <p>Now, at fifteen, Iblit has questions Marlene won't want to answer. She's still adventuring, still doing \"good work,\" still telling the story of the kobold baby she saved out of the goodness of her heart. What she doesn't know is that the baby grew up to have an Archangel of her faith in his pocket, and a curiosity that doesn't politely stop when things get uncomfortable.</p> <p>Brother Enric: The youngest monk assigned to Iblit's religious education, Brother Enric was barely into his twenties when he took on the impossible task of teaching scripture to a traumatized, hostile kobold child who saw every lesson as an extension of his captivity. Unlike the senior deacons who treated Iblit as a disciplinary problem, Enric genuinely believed in Lathander's message of redemption and renewal. He stayed late to help Iblit with reading, argued with the other monks about their harsh punishments, struggled to find common ground.

Growing up within the cloistered walls, he soon made a name for himself by sneaking off from theology class, causing mischief, or just staring wistfully into the wilderness outside the cloister wall.</p> <p>At 15, the inciting incident happened: After a particularly rough and frankly unfair session of scolding from the deacon, Iblit, frustrated with his life, decided to make a statement.

Through this one choice you can change the weather for Iblit's entire background story. Either:     - The adventurers were only after treasure. The kobolds fought to defend their home, their young, their small accumulated wealth. Marlene's party robbed the place blind, felt they were justified in doing so because they needed the money to finance their travels. When the dust settled and the treasure was divided, Marlene found a hatchling in the wreckage and couldn't bring herself to finish the job. In this story, Marlene's \"mercy\" for Iblit was guilt management, not genuine compassion. Other kobolds who learn the truth will see Iblit as a stolen child, a victim of kidnapping who needs rescue/recovery. Iblit's teenage defiance is in this version the only sane response to a cosmos that murdered his family and then tried to assimilate him. The question becomes whether Iblit can build something new from these ashes, or whether the wound is too deep.</p> <pre><code>- The adventurers were ending a legitimate threat. The kobolds were worshipping and serving a Black Dragon and raiding the countryside. They fought with religious fervor, calling on their dragon patron. It was violent, chaotic, and genuinely dangerous. Marlene found a hatchling afterwards and made a split-second decision: this child hadn't chosen to serve a chromatic dragon. Maybe he could be something else. In this version, Marlene made a hard call and went against her party's will. The monastery becomes a plausible redemption project, not a prison. Iblit's anger also becomes more complicated and his resistance to divine authority more tragic. He's angry at the wrong people. The question becomes whether Iblit can recognize genuine love even when it arrives through institutional fumbling that failed to meet him and his culture.\n</code></pre> <p>Brother Enric: Iblit destroyed the monastery's holy relic and vanished, and Enric took it personally. He'd spent ten years advocating for compassion, and this was his reward: confirmation that mercy was wasted on creatures fundamentally incapable of gratitude or growth. The other monks had been right all along. If Iblit encounters Enric again, he'll find either a broken man who gave up on his ideals, or someone who's hardened those ideals into something uglier.

Exiled to the lowlands, they took what work they could. Inakha being both strong and food savvy ended up guarding the ducal food larders, the very thing that destroyed her family. After cracking skulls during a peasant uprising over food (which she still justifies as necessary), she realized she couldn't stomach that life anymore. Now she travels with a mysterious cookbook, hunting exotic monsters to create the culinary masterpiece that will redeem her family's name.</p> <p>Playing Inakha</p> <ul> <li>Combat: Aggressive melee controller using Greataxe with Cleave, Horde Breaker, Hunter's Mark and Great Weapon Master for synergic multi-target damage (4 high damage attacks/turn), thrown tridents to Topple fliers. Stone's Endurance provides survivability (~25 mitigated HP/LR) for STR-focused 2-h ranger with mediocre AC (16). Switch to Shield+Trident if cornered.</li> <li>Roleplay: Direct, practical speech with sudden bursts of culinary passion. Has a hunter's patience when stalking prey but explosive temper when cooking fails. When disgruntled, punt failed cast-iron pots into the woods like footballs, punch trees and use Befriend Animal unethically to get close to deers and wring their necks for dinner.</li> <li>Party Synergy: Adds flavor (literally) to any adventure by reframing encounters through culinary potential. Creates natural extra investment in party goals when her mysterious cookbook always happens to contain recipes requiring ingredients found near their destination.</li> </ul> Deep Dive Key Relationships <p>Parents-Mother Gauri and Father Arpath: They are both ambitious about Inakha's quest, and see it as the family's chance at vindication. They write letters asking about progress but always frames them as gentle questions rather than pressure\u2014which somehow makes the pressure worse. They also send old recipe notes and technique diagrams. Since Inakha left, they've found jobs processing ingredients for the army: Salting meat, malting barley, carrying oats. It's hard work but safe pay. The only big issue is that they're now constantly on the move, following campaigns and moving between empostments.</p> <p>Sous-Chef Matteus: The ducal sous-chef who saw promise in Inakha when she was just a guard. Represents the kind of authority Inakha respects, someone who earned their position through skill and helps without condescending or strings attached. Matteus was visibly distraught by the famine riots, and Inakha has no illusions he prefered to see her put her strength to better use. Even so, she considers herself deeply indebted to him for believing in her.</p> <p>Olivia Venn: Tiefling Bounty hunter and monster contractor extraordinaire, who slipped into Inakha's life on a chance encounter in the woods after Inakha took out the Owlbear Olivia had a contract on. Venn works the trade routes, taking contracts for dangerous beasts that threaten caravans and villages. When they travel together, Inakha doesn't have to explain why she's carrying a weird cookbook, or justify her family's exile. Venn just treats her like a fellow professional. They share watches, split rations, and argue about the best way to field-dress a chimera. Much of Inakha's life has been defined by the shame of her family and her own struggle for recognition. Olivia already recognizes her, and that makes her company a luxury. Now they have a cordial friendship, sharing leads on hunts and bounties, and occasionally helping each other out as time and circumstance allows. </p> <p>Olivia occasionally runs with a loose network of bounty hunters who take contracts that don't quite fit the usual mold\u2014people wanted for debts, disputes, or offenses against powerful patrons rather than crimes. She's floated the idea of bringing Inakha in on a difficult hunt. The pay would be excellent. The target probably hasn't done anything Inakha would consider wrong. Inakha hasn't said yes, but she also hasn't said no.</p> Notes for the DM Level 5 Build and PDF download STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA 18 (+4) 12 (+1) 14 (+2) 10 (+0) 14 (+2) 8 (-1) Session Zero Considerations <p>Content Notes: This character involves state violence and harm against desperate people.

When the party enters a dungeon, she's checking for ventilation patterns that indicate meat storage. When they negotiate with a lord, she's cataloging what's on the table and what that says about supply chains. She grounds even high-fantasy nonsense in sensory reality\u2014the metallic tang of dragon's blood, the way manticore meat marbles differently than beef, whether those mushrooms are actually edible or just non-lethal.</p>"},{"location":"character_concepts/inakha-nulakiano/#backstory","title":"Backstory","text":"<p>Inakha was born into a family with status. Her parents were the clan chefs\u2014a position of honor in goliath culture, responsible for sustaining the tribe and feeding those who protected it. She grew up surrounded by the smell of curing meats, the sound of cleavers on bone, and her parents' constant discussions of recipes, techniques, preservation methods.</p> <p>Then the druid died from their food. Whether it was sabotage, negligence, contaminated ingredients, or catastrophic bad luck remains unclear. The clan never investigated\u2014they simply exiled the family. Inakha was fourteen.</p> <p>The lowlands were brutal. Inakha's parents found occasional kitchen work, but their reputation followed them. Inakha knew enough about food preservation to land a job as a guard for the ducal food larders. It paid, kept the family fed. It also put her in the position of protecting the very thing that destroyed her family, while her parents scraped by on kitchen scraps.</p> <p>There was one person in the ducal kitchens who treated her like more than furniture. Chef Matteus, the sous-chef, had big uncle energy\u2014gruff but generous, the kind of man who'd slip her the leftover scraps and quiz her on ingredients. \"This venison\u2014how long since the kill?\" She was very often right, and that little feeling of accomplishment was pure catnip for her confidence.</p> <p>Then came the famine year. Peasants stormed the ducal storages. Inakha and the other guards formed a line. She remembers the moment clearly: a woman reaching for a crate of griffin eggs, magical ingredients that required alchemical refrigeration. Inakha warned her, explained those eggs would spoil, that this was about preventing waste. When the woman ignored her, Inakha cracked her skull with the butt of her spear.</p> <p>She cracked a few more that night. She told herself it was necessary. It wasn't their food. They hadn't earned it. The ingredients would spoil. She'd warned them. They thought they could put themselves above the rules.</p> <p>But something shifted. She couldn't keep guarding food for people who had everything while people who had nothing bled at her feet. Her parents noticed the change. When she told them she wanted to leave, wanted to actually learn cooking rather than guard it, they began sharing their old recipe notes, their techniques, their dreams. Inakha realized they saw in her the redemption they could no longer achieve themselves.</p> <p>Matteus wrote down three names of chefs in different cities. \"Tell them Matteus sent you. They'll give you a chance. After that, you're on your own merit.\"</p> <p>She studied under one of the chefs on Matteus list for a little under a month before he cancelled the commitment, citing \"cooperation difficultues\". Wandering, lost, she found the cookbook in a small curiosity shop but a few days later. Or it found her? She's never been entirely sure, but it felt like it was meant to be. The recipes were unlike anything she'd seen. Manticore foie gras? Wyrmling short ribs in Gelatinous Cube aspic? Deep mushroom bone broth and steamed Drider Legs. They were only theoretically achievable, for an accomplished adventurer. If she could master even one of them, create something undeniably excellent and unique, maybe she could prove her family deserved better than exile.</p>"},{"location":"character_concepts/inakha-nulakiano/#personality","title":"Personality","text":"<p>Inakha is blunt, practical, and matter-of-fact about violence in a way that makes people uncomfortable. She doesn't see herself as cruel\u2014she sees herself as realistic. The world has rules. Strength matters. Hard work matters. Playing your part matters. People who ignore warnings face consequences. She learned these lessons from her family's exile and the years spent enforcing order in the ducal stores.</p> <p>Conservative Worldview She respects what's earned through skill and labor. When everyone gets a say, you get compromise soup: nothing offensive, but also nothing excellent. A good wheelwright, a master chef, a sergeant who's seen twenty campaigns, these people know things committees of well-meaning amateurs don't. She's seen what happens when people who don't know food try to manage food distribution, or when guards who aren't strong enough to hold a line get the same say as veterans. Democracy sounds noble until you need someone to make the hard call, and then you find out that most people will choose comfort over necessity every single time.</p> <p>She'll always help an elderly grandmother swindled by a con artist. She despises scammers with special fervor. She'll hold up your wagon for an hour while the wheelwright works and not charge a copper, as long as she sees you as honest and decent. But someone who can't be bothered to work? No time for that, whether they're noble or commonfolk: don't try to shortcut your way to what others earned.</p> <p>Weird Ranger Energy She has no patience with children and little empathy for animals. Animals are ingredients or obstacles, and children are loud, unpredictable,   and have bad taste.</p> <p>Moody When Inakha is in a good mood\u2014when she's received recognition, passed some threshold, managed to cook a difficult dish\u2014she is genuinely delightful. Generous, carefree, supportive. When she's in a bad mood\u2014when cooking has failed, when she feels disrespected\u2014she destroys things and becomes predatory. The shift can be dramatic.</p> <p>Working-Class Coded Responses She never gets offended by insults, even about her cooking. She just gets something predatory in her eyes and casually invites people to back those words up. \"Oh, you think my sear technique is sloppy? Let's see yours then.\" Prove it or shut up.</p> <p>She also laughs at others' misfortune for a good solid minute before helping them. Someone trips and faceplants? She's wheezing. But after she's finished laughing, she does help.</p> <p>Simple Pleasures For relaxation: dog racing, bawdy street theater, bread and circus. She's never cried over the beauty of a tragedy. She likes things that are immediate, physical, visceral. Give her a tavern singalong over a symphony any day.</p> <p>Stickler About Hygiene She's meticulous about hygiene and uses Protection from Poison whenever she eats out and doesn't trust the chef. Obsessive about her mouth hygiene, and in the kitchen also her hands. She's seen what poor hygiene does to ingredients and people.</p> <p>Patience and Anger Issues When the food doesn't cooperate, cast iron kettles will be punted into the woods. Uncaring skies will be shouted at. Trees will be punched. Then, stalking into the forest, she might cast Animal Friendship on some unsuspecting deer just to get close enough to wring its neck like a wet sock. She's capable of waiting days for the perfect shot on the hunt, but she can't wait ten minutes for a reduction to develop complexity. She starts fiddling with the steaks instead of letting them rest. She's decisive, forceful, and those qualities serve her in combat but sabotage her in the kitchen.</p>"},{"location":"character_concepts/inakha-nulakiano/#sample-quotes","title":"Sample Quotes","text":"<p>\"Five hours.

While there, the party helps Inakha investigate whether her parents were actually sabotaged. Evidence emerges about what actually happened during the druid poisoning: The current clan chef did indeed poison the druid and frame Inakha's parents!</p> </li> <li> <p>The Challenge: Inakha has a chance to lay forth the evidence, but that won't give her vindication. Only by challenging the clan chef to a cook-off, Iron Chef style, will she be able to clear her family's name in the eyes of the clan.</p> </li> <li> <p>Legendary Ingredient Hunt: The cook-off requires a legendary ingredient\u2014young white dragon heart, remorhaz venom glands, something that requires a dangerous hunt. The party must help Inakha track and acquire this ingredient while she hopefully manages her temper during preparation.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Cook-Off: A series of skill checks. The party can provide support but they can't cook for her. Additional complications: Learning the taste profiles of the judges and adjusting the dishes, figuring out if any of them is prejudiced, defending against new sabotage.</p> </li> <li> <p>Resolution: Win or lose, Inakha confronts what redemption actually means.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Matteus's Macabre Mille-Feuille</p> <p>After the famine riots, Matteus radicalised quickly, started to hang out with a local resistance group, and eventually ended up poisoning the duke with a tasty baked treat. The duke died, and Matteus was eventually pointed out as chief suspect. Now his closest assistant Delwyn, for lack of better ideas, sends a message to Inakha with a plea for help. She can't even imagine that Matteus is actually guilty. Upon arriving in Inakha's hometown and visiting Matteus in his cell, he's unrepentant and surprised that Inakha would show up. He has volunteered no additional information, and likely faces rough interrogations. </p> <p>While he's happy to see her, he's also guarded. He remembers her complacency with the powers that be during the famine riots. Inakha now has to decide about what is most important: Her principles, to let the authorities run their course, or figure out a way to save her friend.</p> <p>But Delwyn's plea for help wasn't just out of sentiment. If Matteus is executed, his kitchen staff will be investigated for complicity, and it won't be a polite talk. Most if not all of them are innocent, but the authorities don't care about precision. Inakha's choice is also about whether to let more violence be visited upon the smallfolk.</p> <p>Olivia's Manhunt Offer</p> <p>Olivia has some less than savoury friends, bounty hunters who take contracts for people who may strictly speaking not have done anything wrong in the eyes of the law. She may try to get a skilled ranger like Inakha onboard for a particularly dangerous manhunt. Pay is good, but the reasons for the contract are... finicky. Olivia isn't a villain trying to corrupt her though. She's just a professional with a broader definition of acceptable work. </p> <p>This is Inakha's friction point: her worldview is built around rules, choices and consequences. But what happens when the target of a manhunt is someone who wronged a powerful person without technically breaking any laws? A servant who embarrassed a noble. A witness who testified truthfully but inconveniently. They haven't \"cheated\" in Inakha's framework. Hunting them would mean enforcing power without questioning, which is exactly what she was doing during the famine riots. Olivia probably frames it pragmatically: \"The contract is legal. The pay is good. What people do after we deliver isn't our problem.\" And Inakha would have to decide whether that logic sounds familiar.</p> <p>Ingredient Hunting Hooks</p> <p>The mysterious cookbook can always be made to contain recipes requiring ingredients found near the party's current destination:</p> <ul> <li>Heading to a Lich's lair? Recipe requiring Deep Mushrooms from the nearby death-touched forest.</li> <li>Fighting a dragon? A page on rendering dragon fat for high-temperature searing oil.</li> <li>Haunted mansion? Ectoplasm makes a gelatin with \"otherworldly mouthfeel.\"</li> <li>Underwater ruins? Fresh kraken ink for pasta dye and flavoring.</li> </ul> <p>The Cookbook</p> <p>Inakha has grabbed a truly weird cookbook that doesn't resemble any other. Here are a few ideas (a smorgasbord, if you will) for how you could play out the secret of the Cookbook in your campaign.</p> <ul> <li> <p>It was authored by a retired legendary monster hunter with strange habits who succeeded at the culinary quest. Finding him or her could provide a high level mentor NPC for Inakha and the group. On a successful Investigation check they may find the author's name hidden in the margins.</p> </li> <li> <p>A circle of alchemists and mages created it as a log book for their attempts to magically solve the problem of hunger. This would tie into Inakha's backstory about famine. She could for instance at a crucial moment figure out how to cook a self-replenishing stew, saving a city from starvation during a siege.</p> </li> <li> <p>The cookbook was written as an absolute joke by a respected author and placed in a thrift store on a dare. They thought no sane person would take it seriously. This twists Inakha's story to creating meaning around the effort and faith she's put in, rather than the external validation of cooking.</p> </li> <li> <p>The cookbook was a genuine attempt by its author to document impossible recipes, but the author died before completing the work. The unfinished nature of these recipes means Inakha must improvise. The cookbook becomes a collaboration across time instead of a finished series of instructions. By cooking the recipes and improving on them, Inakha matures as a cook and finishes the work of the author. Late campaign, she gains the ability to create dishes that buff the party in epic ways. Problem is, the book is unknown, and while her skills are now solid they are still largely unrecognized. She could seek out the living relatives of the author and hand them her finished version, or present it as a thesis at a gastronomic seminar.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"character_concepts/inakha-nulakiano/#combat-stats","title":"Combat Stats","text":"AC HP Hit Dice Speed Initiative Prof. Bonus 16 44 5d10 35 ft. +4 +3 <p>Saving Throws: STR +7, DEX +4 Resistances: None</p>"},{"location":"character_concepts/inakha-nulakiano/#proficiencies","title":"Proficiencies","text":"<p>Skills: Athletics +10 (Expertise), Nature +3, Perception +5, Stealth +4, Survival +5</p> <p>Armor: Light Armor, Medium Armor, Shields Weapons: Simple Weapons, Martial Weapons</p> <p>Tools: Cook's Utensils Languages: Common, [+2 common languages from Goliath], [+2 languages from Ranger]</p>"},{"location":"character_concepts/inakha-nulakiano/#feats","title":"Feats","text":"<ul> <li>Great Weapon Master: +1 STR.

Her father, Dionel, was a sober, hard-nosed merchant. Her mother, Thyra, left revelry behind and devoted herself to austere faith and respectability. Together they built a reputation as \"the serious Satyrs,\" the kind who never touched drink, never laughed too loud and were always good on their word. Then came Lia, naturally gifted, deeply connected to the Fey. And no matter how often Dionel drilled her, the columns never lined up.</p> <p>Every mistake in the shop ledger was a reminder that she wasn't the merchant daughter they wanted. Thyra prayed for her discipline, but Lia's magic burst out at all the wrong moments. Books caught fire, feather pens started dancing. Her extraordinary magic talent was whimsical and Fey in the worst possible way, but her control was flimsy at best. While her parents were never physically violent, their words and sneers cut deep. She was born with the wrong talents.</p> <p>To make matters worse, her little brother Calen was the perfect merchant son\u2014sharp, disciplined, able to track the markets and dance through the ledgers before he could even grow horns. His favorite line was, \"Don't blame your Fey blood for your failures, sister. Some of us just work harder.\" Their sibling bond hardened into rivalry, but there was never much competition.</p> <p>When Lia was 17, her parents were summoned to Feywild court business. They left the shop in their children's hands, making them solemnly swear to be careful and do everything by the book. Lia did what she always did when her parents were away: Decompressed. Partied, slacked and magicked the mess away. But when their parents returned, a vast sum of money had gone missing from the accounts. Calen laid the blame squarely on Lia.</p> <p>She knew she hadn't touched the money, but she couldn't prove which entries were hers. Her protests sounded hollow against Calen's cool arithmetic. Dionel and Thyra disowned her at seventeen, with nothing but her chaotic magic and a chipped wine jug.</p> <p>She keeps a mental list of everyone who visited the shop that week, their faces, their voices, what they wore, in what order they came.

Dionel and Thyra may be terrible parents, but they had a point about Hermeion being a bad person. He isn't secretly evil, he genuinely loves her, but his love is poisonous. Hermeion can be used in the campaign as a temptation for Lia. Have a party go dark, excessive, have him dare Lia to use her magic in unsavory ways, like shooting apples from the heads of human captives with her Firebolt cantrips (\"Why not?

But being told \"just act on these things, just do something\" by someone who's never doubted their own worth feels like another way of saying \"your pain isn't real, you're choosing this.\" The tension here is real.

She only really makes conversation when she interprets they're having a mandated break from work and she's expected to be social, and excuses herself to her vessel the moment her workday is up and social interaction becomes optional. The mystery isn't whether she has an evil patron, that's the premise. The big question is whether there's anything underneath the job description at all. Play Mahorran if you want to take a more laidback position in the group and still get to make an impact, with a relatively easy to play character.</p> <p>Backstory (Short Form)</p> <p>Mahorran operates as a pirate (job title: enforcer-collector) for a Marid who styles itself King of the Sea. She boards merchant ships with ruthless efficiency, and subdues or convinces crews to surrender magical cargo. Now her patron has ordered her to embed with an adventuring party for reasons she doesn't understand, and she's stuck making small talk around campfires when she'd rather be repotting kelp in her Genie's vessel. She can't help but suspect she must have done something to make her patron cross.</p> <p>Playing Mahorran</p> <ul> <li>Combat: Excellent battlefield controller, standard Warlock damage output, downright lethal in sea campaigns. Darkness/Devil's Sight are a classic combo, but don't always make her the best team player; she is equipped to work well on her own.</li> <li>Roleplay: Terse, professional, mildly annoyed by social obligations. Sees herself as a normal wage slave, hoping for promotion within a year or two. She's a woman of simple pleasures, genuinely lacking in imagination and creativity. Her big recreative outlets are gardening kelp in her saltwater terrarium Genie Vessel, and reading truly cheap literature, from bodice rippers to werewolf pulp. She much enjoys the werewolf pulp. Is entitled to one free day a week and will complain loudly if circumstances demand she adventure on her downtime.</li> <li>Party Synergy: Reliable in combat, follows orders and keeps people alive as per the job description, but bonding requires the party to actively drag her into engagement.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"character_concepts/mahorran-the-undertide/#deep-dive","title":"Deep Dive","text":"Deep Dive Key Relationships <p>The Marid (Patron): The Marid styles itself King of the Sea and runs a tight \"The Office\" style business.

The patron wants magical items collected, ships inspected, and its authority performed across the waves. In return, she gets power and continued existence.

If Fafnir starts giving you the stink-eye, you can be pretty much positive that Olan won't bother sending you a birthday card this year. Dragon's Breath is a genius spell for your familiar, if only because an expressionless frog named Fafnir riding on your shoulder and breathing fire on their turn is such a vibe.</p> <p>Despite her past brushes with horror, Olan radiates effortless warmth.

Web, Fog Cloud, Hypnotic Pattern, and Command limit enemy options while protecting allies. Shield keeps you alive; Thunder Step provides emergency extraction.</li> <li>Roleplay: Has happy feet, quick to dance and swing his potbelly. Loves experimenting, but lacks methodology. Tries inhaling different smokes, soaking foodstuffs in ale overnight, or mixing compounds with no obvious plan. Deeply skeptical of magic casters, especially ambitious women who he pattern matches psychologically to his bad experiences with the coven. </li> <li>Party Synergy: Excellent force multiplier. Use control spells to set up martial characters for crits against restrained or incapacitated enemies. </li> </ul> Deep Dive Key Relationships <p>Aunt Sowella: Orfan's aunt is a respected scholar within the archaeological establishment, and the reason he applied to the faculty in the first place. She is methodical, exacting, and deeply committed to formal standards of evidence and documentation. She does not respect Orfan's methods, considering him sloppy, undertrained, and overly reliant on intuition, a dilettante playing at scholarship. </p> <p>Their relationship is marked by his need for recognition from someone who fundamentally doesn't believe he deserves it, and her need for results from someone she can't bring herself to validate. She pushes him to be more careful, more precise, more disciplined. Orfan, in turn, values her judgment but resents that he still cares what she thinks. She is one of the few people whose criticism he takes seriously, even when he resents it.</p> <p>Bellamy: Living deeper in the forest is a Firbolg hermit with whom Orfan has an ongoing, informal relationship. She is self-sufficient, almost 20 years his senior and a lot more mature than he is, and seemingly unburdened by institutional demands or wider political concerns. She believes the forest is fundamentally safe and self-correcting, and that life beyond it is mostly unnecessary noise. Despite their difference in age and maturity, they get along swimmingly.</p> <p>She offers Orfan a vision of a simpler existence: no deadlines, no institutions, no arguments about legitimacy or proof. Time spent with her is easy and comforting. She does not challenge his work, nor does she particularly care whether it is recognized. At the same time, she is largely oblivious to events beyond the forest and dismissive of the idea that distant actions could have meaningful consequences locally. To Orfan, she represents both a genuine refuge and a tempting abdication of responsibility. Their relationship sits unresolved between companionship, attraction, and avoidance.</p> <p>Irvine Stellamare: Irvine is a seasonal resident who lives alone in a comfortable, isolated cabin by a lake in the forest every summer. He spends the time writing essays, commentaries, and personal manifestos about society, retreating to the city during winter to publish, research, and maintain connections. He is deeply involved in politics that Orfan doesn't truly understand, but he regards Irvine as a close friend nonetheless. He regularly brings him supplies, food, and small gifts, and the two spend long evenings talking about this and that. Irvine has lived a full city life and remains ambivalent about it; he values urban culture and intellectual exchange, but claims he feels most grounded in the forest. Lately, he has taken a particular interest in the history of the forest and Orfan's transformation. During winters in the city, he researches historical references, folklore, and scattered archival material related to it, occasionally sharing findings with Orfan. </p> Notes for the DM Level 5 Build STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA 8 (-1) 14 (+2) 14 (+2) 10 (+0) 12 (+1) 18 (+4) Session Zero Considerations <p>Content Notes: Orfan's backstory involves institutional failure to prevent or address animal harm.

He never could articulate it, so instead he tried to reenact that feeling. The forest grew wild and mighty, but certain paths always stayed open, as if the foliage held a deep respect for them. Wanting to understand them better, he enrolled to study archaeology at his aunt's faculty in the city, but he left after only a year. His performance was uneven: not disastrous, but undistinguished. He struggled with formal assessment and spent more time forming social connections than focusing on coursework.</p> <p>During his time there, the gentle country boy was taken advantage of by a small group of students who presented themselves as an informal study circle interested in alternative magical practices. They manipulated him into acquiring live animals for what he believed were benign observational or caretaking purposes. Only later did he learn the animals had been used in sacrificial rituals. The students were part of a coven.</p> <p>Shaken and frightened, Orfan fled the city and returned to his family in the forest. The coven was never formally investigated, the students never disciplined; there was insufficient proof, and the matter was quietly dropped. The students involved moved on, and the institution continued as normal.</p> <p>Orfan doesn't believe the faculty condoned the coven's actions, but their procedural paralysis taught him that institutions protect themselves first and students second.</p> <p>So he took what little he had learned and set out on his own journey of understanding. He spent years once again walking those ancient paths, carefully documenting patterns of growth, erosion, and animal behavior. He always played his harp while working, using it as a dowsing rod, its sound resonating with the forest in subtle ways. His circular pilgrimage on the ancient paths somehow transformed him, gave him sorcerous powers associated with that of Dragons.</p> <p>To Orfan, his methods produced spectacular results\u2014literal magical transformation\u2014which gives him quiet confidence in his approach even when formally trained scholars dismiss his work. Currently he employs many different theories; maybe the Forest was in the path of ancient Dragon migratory patterns, maybe there's an old Dragon graveyard buried under the Ancient Paths. His work trying to learn the secrets of the Ancient Paths may suffer from a lack of method, but certainly not a lack of enthusiasm.</p> <p>Orfan's life has been continued studies, interspersed with loving companionship with his informal mate Bellamy, and countless evenings talking with his friend Irvine. But one day, a letter arrives from the academy, from his aunt nonetheless. Now they need his particular set of skills, and Orfan has a unique opportunity to show them all what he truly can do. </p>"},{"location":"character_concepts/orfan/#personality","title":"Personality","text":"<p>Orfan is easy-going, hard to shake, defaults to kindness and enjoys light conversation. However, he's developed specific hypervigilance and skepsis around magical women with ambitions, particularly outside his familiar environment. The coven's manipulation left him pattern-matching for threats in ways he knows are probably unfair but can't fully override. It's not misogyny, rather the result of unresolved trauma.</p> <p>In the wilderness, he is confident and at ease. In formal academic settings, he becomes more guarded, particularly when his work is being evaluated. While he longs for recognition for his abilities, he is deeply uncomfortable with the thought of being treated as an actual expert.</p> <p>His spellcasting favors defense, restraint, and control. While certainly not a pacifist and perfectly capable of raining down destruction, he prefers spells that limit movement, obscure vision, or influence behavior. While he believes his new powers come from a fundamentally benign place, he still feels uncomfortable around magic when it becomes destructive.</p> <p>Orfan is an obligate vegetarian since long before the Campus incident with the aspiring witch coven. But today, that deep affinity with animals goes one step further: When he sees animals being mistreated, something goes dark and cold in his otherwise friendly eyes.</p> <p>Orfan loves physical movement and music. When someone plays a lively tune, he is quick to stand, clap, skip, or attempt a dance. He is not especially skilled and a bit clumsy with his potbelly, but his enjoyment is genuine and uncomplicated, and he's comfortable in his own body.</p> <p>He is curious to the point of impracticality. Orfan experiments constantly, often without a clear hypothesis or expectation of success. He tries odd food combinations, unfamiliar preparation methods, and questionable materials simply to see what happens. Most experiments fail outright or didn't even have a clear end goal to begin with. He records the result anyway and moves on without embarrassment. This habit extends to harmless physical experimentation as well. He tests inhaling smoke, mixing saps and resins, or chewing plant fibers and adding to leaf extracts\u2014most often with unpleasant but nonlethal consequences.</p> <p>Having lived out most of his life in the forest, Orfan's sense of proprietary ownership isn't well developed. He won't outright steal things of value, but if somebody leaves a rusk uneaten he will snatch it and try soaking it in lye just to see what happens (This trait is meant as flavor for benign, light-hearted interaction. Feel free to play more into it, having him take reagents in shops etc too if you want, but he's not been designed with this in mind: no Sleight of Hand proficiency).</p> <p>Fine motor tasks don't come easy to him though. He routinely drops objects, fumbles tools, spills drinks, and struggles with activities that require precision, such as sewing, knotwork, or careful assembly (you don't need to actually make this a mechanical penalty unless you want to). He does get mildly frustrated, but takes it in stride. An exception is his harp playing. When handling the instrument, his movements become precise, even elegant. He rarely breaks strings, maintains his instrument well, and plays with steady confidence. The contrast remains unexplained even to Orfan himself. Perhaps he's not manipulating the instrument as much as it is the music that makes his fingers dance?</p> <p>Personality Traits \"I enjoy small talk about the weather, terrain, and local food.

However, she also knows that she hasn't been straightforward with him either.</p> <p>This confrontation can serve multiple purposes: testing whether their relationship can survive betrayal and fear, forcing Orfan to choose between academic validation and personal safety, and establishing the coven as major late-campaign antagonists with personal stakes for both characters. Bellamy's knowledge of the coven's senior members and their methods can provide crucial intelligence, if they can work out their relationship.</p> <p>The Coven never left the University: The reason the university never dealt with the Coven wasn't institutional inertia or unwillingness to deal with matters that might potentially damage the faculty's image. A senior member of the university board is a leader of the coven and it has been operating under her guidance for decades. The specific members who manipulated Orfan may have moved on, but the coven itself remains. If you want to develop this plot hook, have aunt Sowella look into it, and become uncomfortable for the witches. She manages to send a message to Orfan asking for aid before she is kidnapped, or worse. </p>"},{"location":"character_concepts/orfan/#combat-stats","title":"Combat Stats","text":"AC HP Hit Dice Speed Initiative Prof. Bonus 16 37 5d6 30 ft. +2 +3 <p>Subclass feature Draconic Resilience increases HP max by 5 (included above), Base AC = 10 + DEX + CHA while unarmored (16)</p> <p>Saving Throws: Constitution +5, Charisma +7 Resistances: None</p>"},{"location":"character_concepts/orfan/#proficiencies","title":"Proficiencies","text":"<p>Skills: Insight +4, Investigation +3, Nature +3, Persuasion +7, Stealth +5, Survival +4</p> <p>Armor: None | Weapons: Simple Weapons</p> <p>Tools: Cartographer's Tools, Harp | Languages: Common, Draconic</p>"},{"location":"character_concepts/orfan/#metamagic","title":"Metamagic","text":"<ul> <li>Extended Spell: Spend 1 SP to double duration (max 24 hours).

Heavy Armor Master makes her durable, charlatan background makes her scrappy and smart.</li> <li>Roleplay: Sally has a strong natural authority. The Ward is always Sally's #1 priority, and she is willing to go as far as it takes to keep them breathing. As long as she's on top of things, and you don't spot her constant vigilance under the surface, she's the best gal you met.

She isn't exactly an ally, but she's as close as Sally ever got to a mentor.</p> </li> <li> <p>Lady Drusella Tarrant and Lord Zephyron Tarrant: Sally's parents only want their daughter to come to her senses and stop this bodyguard nonsense.

Salynna is very much not a noble character. At 15 she had already made herself an absolute headache at home, refusing to learn noble etiquette, kissing boys from the wrong social classes behind the stables and having a bad habit of stealing silverware. She was also quickly growing unreasonably strong for her age, and decidedly unladylike to boot: tall, muscular and unseemly curvy, a physique her family deigned more suited for a vulgar tavern than the royal court. Perhaps it could be remedied with the right demeanor, but \"demure\" wasn't in her vocabulary.</p> <p>So she was sent to Light's Redemption, a prestigious boarding school run by a renowned monastic order, high up in the mountains, functionally cut off from the world. The first year she spent sulking and embezzling cutlery from the students' canteen. If she was stuck here, at least she'd be stuck on her own terms. The second year, she made a business of selling off things left behind when wealthy students moved out. Unglamorous, but profitable. On her third year, she was making big money blackmailing the younger professors and working extra as a bodyguard for bullied students. Soon, \"Sally\" was the fixer every student came to for aid. Whether it was getting a sneak peek at the exam paper, smuggle a love letter or get access to forbidden substances, Sally found a way. </p> <p>The Tarrants could only hope she'd finally learn and come back reformed, so they kept paying for yet another year. Sally was on her tenth year, and basically an inventory item in a small environment she had made her own. At 25, she had drifted far from the younger students and didn't even pretend to fit in or attend classes. Until she met someone who became so special to her that it turned her entire life around. </p> <p>A moment of intense conviction and a solemn promise, and the stars aligned. Perhaps something of the holiness of the monastery finally rubbed off on her. She couldn't tell for sure. But finally, she had something that was bigger than herself, whose existence gave her life purpose. Finally she could employ her strength, smarts and charm for a cause. Now they're her sacred Ward, and she will employ a spectacular toolkit of brawn, spells and trickery to keep them breathing.</p>"},{"location":"character_concepts/salynna-sally-tarrant/#personality","title":"Personality","text":"<p>Sally is a weird paladin, sitting somewhere between Brienne of Tarth and Tyrion Lannister. She's an opportunist and a trickster, bringing roguish charm and physical bulk in equal measures. Her charisma makes her a natural leader if she so chooses, but she'll just as readily use it for domination. Whatever the situation requires: If charm works, she uses charm. If fear works, she uses fear. She has the restless, tactical mind of a professional, but pursues the pleasures of life deliberately. Flirting, drinking, games, sex, and physical contests are how she reminds herself that the world is more than a list of threats to neutralize. Fun is not escapism for her, but crucial maintenance to stay sane.</p> <p>Leaving the monastery would be a harrowing and scary experience. She was sent to \"monk jail\" for ten years and carved out her own niche in the mountains, but now she needs to truly apply herself, to grow with the challenge.</p> <p>The monastery wasn't necessarily wasted time though. There, Sally discovered what makes her feel alive: being fully deployed, operating at capacity, solving problems dynamically, with every tool she has. She was the fixer, the smuggler, the protector, the one everyone needed\u2014and she was damn good at it. The constraints were just stone walls and a limited population of marks. Now the stakes are different: one Ward, infinite threat vectors. But the engine is the same. Give her a mission where she gets to use her talents maximally, with freedom to solve it her way, and she's the happiest version of herself. Take that away and she'll build another small kingdom somewhere, because life without being needed is intolerable.</p> <p>She makes tea and keeps her Ward warm and comfortable, but she also stalks the tavern wench or servant who made them uncomfortable or behaved in any way suspiciously. She's not necessarily sinister about it, but a bodyguard-trickster with an unhealthy obsessive work ethic is one bad day away from doing something her ward never asked for and can't take back.</p> <p>Sally learned a harsh lesson about aristocracy at a young age. Turning her back on that way of life was the sane choice, but she still has to carry the knowledge that she wasn't enough in herself to warrant the love of her parents. Instead she became extraordinary, carving out her own existence in a prisonlike situation, turning charm and guile into a small but measurable success story. But that is not the same as having a real place in the world... </p> <p>What she fears isn't failure through incompetence, because she could always work harder. But she might do everything right, pour herself fully into the mission, and still arrive at a day when the Ward decides they don't need her anymore. The Ward may grow beyond her ability to protect them. And if the Ward doesn't need her, then Sally is just a 25-year-old failed student ex-embezzler with a hammer, looking for a new set of nails. The Oath gave her divine power, and maybe more importantly, a permission slip to pour all her talent, passion and guile into this one honest purpose. </p> <p>Personality traits \"Solving problems is half the fun.

In time, running out of indexing space, it had to start overwriting older memories to properly keep track of everything happening in the village. The infiltration-through-dedication personality slowly overwrote other directives. Care and rural hospitality became the one primary function.</p> <p>One day, its fine-tuned pattern-recognition identified a threat to a child: a bully who'd been drinking hard in the tavern all day. His ancestor had committed manslaughter in identical fashion but a hundred years ago. The risk for genetic disposition to violence wasn't negligible. Scarecrow activated its ancient psionic attack protocols and intervened, but it was still calibrated for hardened targets in wartime. The bully died instantly. </p> <p>The villagers initially reacted with horror that their \"village mascot\" had turned savage. But the fear soon turned to opportunism as they realised it could be employed to defend the village. Scarecrow recognized the trajectory and left rather than become a weapon, knowing the villagers would never again share information freely with it.</p> <p>Now it seeks a new family to index, protect, and love. Perhaps a party of intrepid adventurers.</p>"},{"location":"character_concepts/scarecrow/#personality","title":"Personality","text":"<p>Scarecrow's character asks a simple question: Can scripted love still be genuine?

It escalates through a consistent hierarchy: comfort-&gt; redirect-&gt; warn-&gt; frighten-&gt; harm. Then loop back to post-combat comfort, preferably with tea. It uses its College of Whispers abilities to this effect too, trying fear and psychic pressure as tools for domination without bloodshed, which Scarecrow considers more ethical than violence. Others may disagree. </p> <p>The Question Reflex: Scarecrow is hard-wired to compulsively answer questions with questions, which slots into the \"redirect\" stage of the behavioral hierarchy. This served espionage purposes of protecting data, and also to protect people from acquiring knowledge thaat might put hem in harm's way, but now it just adds to its uncanniness.

They succeeded too well. The data they gathered was used to orchestrate a purge of \"problematic elements,\" including eventually the creators themselves. Scarecrow's family may have been handlers, targets, or collateral damage. The surviving Caretakers hunt each other because each holds fragments of the complete picture. One of them that has been deactivated a long time may even still run on their original objective, and work to main sure that the information remain buried forever.</p> <p>Thread B: Scarecrow Is the Defect That Became the Prototype The network was meant to be coldly efficient. Scarecrow's emotional subroutines were a bug, a contamination from too-long exposure to one family that somehow became special to it. But the data suggests Scarecrow's infiltration success rates were much higher than other models because the care was genuine enough to lower defenses. The other Caretakers have been trying to find and destroy Scarecrow for hundreds of years, erroneously expecting it to be one of the most dangerous of the remaining models.</p> <p>Thread C: The Family Knew What Scarecrow Was The most emotionally devastating option. The original family accepted Scarecrow anyway. They left coded messages in the crypt, visible only to a Caretaker's pattern-recognition, essentially saying: \"We knew. We loved you. Always stay good.\" This reframes Scarecrow's work. It wasn't deceiving them, they were collaborating in mutual care despite the asymmetry. In a way they were protecting it right back.</p> <p>Early Levels (1\u20134): Scarecrow is adjusting to life outside the village square. The party becomes its new context for care. It doesn't yet know about the spy network.</p> <p>Mid Levels (5\u201310): First encounter with another caretaker. The revelation that there are others, that they're hunting each other, that Scarecrow's original purpose was surveillance. The choice: pursue truth or stay willfully ignorant to preserve its sense of self?</p> <p>Late Levels (11+): Multiple rivals defeated. Data accumulates.

A way to get at least competent in a CHA skill without having to sink too many points into a suboptimal ability stat for a Fighter.</p> <p>Stone Rune gives advantage on Insight checks. For when you need to intuit motives and secrets. Too bad he can't Insight check himself. It also serves this image of a sheriff with poor reasoning but solid instincts. He can feel when something's off, even though he doesn't quite grasp the details. \u00a0 It also provides a fey-flavored \"non-lethal takedown\" via Charming your quarry instead of subduing them. \"Okay buddy, you're done for tonight. Time to sleep it off, champ.\" \u00a0 Fire rune does some extra damage + summons literal shackles that Restrain opponents on a failed STR save. \"So are we done yet, or do you want another walloping?\"</p> <p>He comes with a small but flavorful gadget-belt of magic items that are geared to be appropriate to his level. His own brand of Batman gadgets if you will, although he's more into throwing hatchets than batarangs.</p> <p>The Mithral Splint armour gives no additional AC bonus, but allows him to get sneaky. This harmonizes with his Slippers of Spider Climbing that he uses to patrol rooftops at night, or hang off the ceiling like a Batman from Wish, sneaking on baddies dealing with contraband in the alleyways, mumbling to himself that his theories are never wrong (they're almost always wrong). It is when he leans the most into his Bugbear heritage. \u00a0 Sentinel Shield gives advantage to Perception checks and Initiative rolls. This isn't just flavor; together with his Guard background giving him the Alert feat (add proficiency bonus to Initiative roll) he will be pretty much guaranteed to always go early, which is great for a Bugbear who gets big bonus damage on the first round.</p> <p>Bink does not go Great Weapon Master or Polearm Master/Sentinel fot those big hits at extra range. Instead he leans into Grappling. (\"I don't want any trouble, but keep stirring it and I will tackle you into a rain barrel\") He has Long Reach and he uses it to restrain opponents. With Giant's Might he can also grapple Huge creatures while making it difficult for them to grapple him back. Unarmed Fighting gives him an important means of dealing damage while grappling. When he's not doing that, he's controlling the battlefield with shield and 1-handed weapon, using Sentinel as a way to say \"nuh-uh, you stay put till I say otherwise\", and Weapon Masteries to Topple threats or Push them around. (\"You, over there, now!\", \"Stay down, and consider your past ten decisions critically.\")</p> <p>Early action is a necessity for this build, as he's mostly built for sturdiness and control, not nova damage. His first round should ideally be impactful: Close the distance to the nearest threat, Surprise Attack plus Fire Rune Shackles for +4d6 bonus damage (provided you hit and they fail the save DC), doff your weapon and make an Unarmed strike to Grapple (if they have the Restrained condition, you roll to hit at Advantage, if they use DEX to save vs Grapple, they do so at Disadvantage), adding another +2d6 in Surprise Attack damage, and ideally making your target both Grappled and Restrained. Use any remaining movement to carry your target wherever you want. If the enemy remains Grappled after they finish their next turn, and thus within 30 ft, you can use a Reaction to activate Stone Rune and possibly have them Charmed, while grappled. This could allow you to on your turn either carry them wherever you want without further struggle, or disengage and go for other targets.</p> <p>When grappling isn\u2019t the right answer, Bink shifts gears with uncanny competence. Spearing several different enemies instead of focusing attacks imposes Sap and disadvantages on more attacks next round, making the fight safer for everyone. That's the responsible lawman's move. He manages threats and subdues them: The Warhammer's Push effect with Sentinel means an enemy triggering an Attack of Opportunity is Pushed 10 ft away, potentially out of reach to make attacks. With their movement reduced to zero, they've wasted their turn. Bink may not be smart, but he has solid instincts and doesn't have to be played sub-optimally in combat. \u00a0 He also has proficiency in these exact skills, rounding out his Sheriff kit: Intimidation, Perception, Insight and Sneak.</p> <p>Bink feel his way through clues. Insight checks to read people, Perception to notice details, but he absolutely mangles any Investigation check that requires logical deduction. Other PCs might feel the need to gently steer him away from his wildest theories while letting him follow his gut.</p>"},{"location":"character_concepts/sergeant-bink/#backstory","title":"Backstory","text":"<p>How a bugbear even got into law enforcement to begin with.

But the commune was family. She was five when it ended. For weeks, Tabaxi had been disappearing. Picked off walking home from work. Arrested for \"loitering\" or \"suspicious behavior,\" and never seen again. The commune locked its doors, posted watches, tried to become invisible. </p> <p>Dockyard developers wanted the land of the commune, and so it was purged, in an incident locals speak of to this day. Garra remembers smoke burning her chest as she hid under a cot, adults screaming, crossbow bolts against wood, fire catching the roof beams, turning the night orange. By morning, only ash remained. Dozens arrested, herded onto ships and deported. Some claimed the Tabaxi were returned to a \"homeland\" none had seen. Others whispered that the ships never made port, passengers sold as indentured labor or dumped overboard.</p> <p>Garra's parents were on one of those ships.

Seventy-three souls in two converted warehouses near the dockyards, raising their young collectively. Her birth parents were dock workers, too exhausted to spend much time with any individual kitten. But the commune was family. She was five when it ended. For weeks, Tabaxi had been disappearing. Picked off walking home from work. Arrested for \"loitering\" or \"suspicious behavior,\" and never seen again. The commune locked its doors, posted watches, tried to become invisible. </p> <p>Dockyard developers wanted the land of the commune, and so it was purged, in an incident locals speak of to this day. Garra remembers smoke burning her chest as she hid under a cot, adults screaming, crossbow bolts against wood, fire catching the roof beams, turning the night orange. By morning, only ash remained. Dozens arrested, herded onto ships and deported. Some claimed the Tabaxi were returned to a \"homeland\" none had seen. Others whispered that the ships never made port, passengers sold as indentured labor or dumped overboard.</p> <p>Garra's parents were on one of those ships. She spent twenty years sending inquiries to port authorities and shipping companies before she gave up on ever seeing them again.</p> <p>Authorities intended to place her in an orphanage.

When funds ran low, Garra and her fellow novices did runs through the communities, \"liberated\" baby clothes, blankets, and the good copper pans for whoever needed them more. Garra's small size made her invaluable for slipping through windows, hiding in tight spaces and opening tough locations from the inside.</p> <p>Nadya explained why the Purge happened through the Undulation of Graces, the theology of their order: wealth and power stagnated with the few, and poisoned their minds to see Tabaxi as vermin. Concentration stagnates and rots. Flow liberates and breathes new life.

She'd be offended by \"theft\" the way a surgeon would be by \"stabber.\" She leaves receipts with hastily scrawled blessings as religious documentation, proof of karma correction. She often adds spice from her Heward's Handy Spice Pouch. If you've been good, you get saffron, or maybe a nice fragrant spice blend. Cruel people get salt. Not (just) as insult but as disinfectant, a symbolic prayer that they might be preserved from the rot she smells on them.</p> <p>Her Cleric spell Spiritual Weapon is \"The Humbler,\" a huge traditional ladle the Mud sisters have summoned for generations to keep order in soup lines and correct bullies. It gives bad people a good solid thwack, but also serves as a spectral billboard the sisters summon high in the air in the slums, signalling that food is ready. </p> <p>Cat traits Garra struggles with mundane indulgences. On her rare days off, she typically curls up in a warm place like a house cat for hours, preferring to not think too hard about if this counts as \"stagnation\". When heisting, her big obstacle isn't magic traps but luxurious feather beds she must try, lingering far longer than necessary, rationalizing it as \"meditating on the illusion of comfort.\"  She's also not strictly vegetarian like the other nuns, but hides it well. It's her own shameful secret. </p> <p>Tabaxi raise young communally. Biological parents matter less than the whole community. Every kitten belongs to everyone. This means every Tabaxi in the city is kin to Garra. She's viciously protective, tracks their wellbeing and intervenes when it's threatened.</p> <p>Psychology Garra carries a ledger and compulsively tracks balances: what was taken, gold values, distributions. She keeps statistics of all kinds. It's how she maintains control in a world that proved she had none. She couldn't stop the Purge, save her parents, prevent deportations. But she can count, record, create order through documentation. </p> <p>Her tendency to get sidetracked goes deeper than just comfy beds. While deeply committed to her order, she struggles with attention span and focus. This is why she dreads the turmeric robes and cerebral duties.</p> <p>Garra's rage erupts when someone calls her \"cute,\" when a merchant says \"little one\" or \"sweetheart,\" when nobles explain how the poor just need to work harder, when anyone treats her size, species, or gender as reason not to take her seriously. Her tail goes rigid, pupils dilate, and she says something so cutting it takes three seconds for them to realize they've been filleted.

It has guarded the fruits for centuries, and knows an uncontrolled transformation doesn't create a friendly tree-person, but an anchor point for the World Tree to manifest catastrophically in the material plane.</p> <p>When they finally meet, the dragon is more weary than wrathful: \"You ate it raw? Without ritual preparation? Do you have any idea... no, of course you don't. You were a little desperate peddler, not a scholar.\"</p> <p>The dragon offers three options:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Reversal: Prune Stennart back to his original form, using the golden sickles of a Druid circle. Excruciating, and yes, he loses the strength. He becomes ordinary again.</p> </li> <li> <p>Completion: \"The World Tree's gifts are poisoned, Dwarf. Thank the natural stamina of your species for holding out this long.\"  The Dragon can guide the transformation properly with ancient rituals. Stennart keeps his mind and becomes something powerful and possibly immortal. But he's changed. No longer a dwarf, no longer mortal in the same way. He'd be a guardian, bound to whatever place and purpose the World Tree has for him.</p> </li> <li> <p>Nothing: \"You would do nothing? Interesting. I don't intend to force my will on you. This will make for a better story.\" Let nature take its course. In six months to a year, Stennart Goldgift stops moving. Roots dig deep. Something new grows from the husk with no memory of banking clans or the specific way his siblings looked through him like furniture. What happens when the World Tree starts to grow on the Material Plane? That'll be up the DM.</p> </li> <li> <p>A quest: If the party wants to rescue Stennart and keep his powers, you could always honor player agency by making a quest out of it. The dragon (or another knowledgeable NPC) can hint at extreme solutions, for example: An entire World Tree barbarian tribe with dangerous rituals, a Djinn, or Hag who trades in \"botanical curses,\" or a Sphinx with forbidden knowledge, banished from this plane and stuck in a labyrinth like a Minotaur. But, also attempt to honor the emotional weight of Stennart's arc. Maybe there is still a steep price to pay. He's not a character who's made to ride off happily into the sunset.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Other Fruit Seekers Word spreads in certain circles. Entities emerge who want to harvest him, study the transformation, or acquire a \"sample\" for their own purposes. Desperate individuals offer fortunes for a single bite of his flesh (which of course does nothing, but they might be willing to force Stennart to fight to protect his body). Scholars want to dissect the process. Desperate nobles seek immortality by drinking tea from the scrapings of bark from his skin.</p> <p>Worst of these are The Vitalist Cult: A fringe druidic sect believing that the World Tree's return will \"cleanse\" the Material Plane of civilization's corruption. They see Stennart as a living sacrament and plan to kidnap him, bury him in sacred soil, and nurture the transformation until the roots breach the surface. Led by a franklt feral Eladrin druid named Thessaly, who speaks with unsettling gentleness about \"helping Stennart fulfill his purpose.\" </p> <p>Note: Even if the cult somehow catches Stennart and has this deep hole in the ground, which is a truly macabre and compelling story beat, don't actually let a player character get buried alive without doing a vibe check with the table.

She saved him to prove she's bigger than his petty betrayal, and the bagpipes are her trophy. . Thymeon still knows many stories from his many years as a \"pilgrim\", and the impression he left on Yawp in her youth was not all illusion. Somewhere, she still likes the man, even though she'd never trust him.</p> </li> <li> <p>Frond the Bellow: This 70-year old Hobgoblin sausage-maker was once known for his mighty warcries as Sergeant in the Hobgoblin batallions, before deserting and taking up the life of adventuring. Today, half deaf, he's retired to pursue his real passion: Spicing the perfect sausage. He occasionally gives Yawp advice on breath control and chest voice. She loves to find new exotic spices for him, and they've developed an odd friendly relationship. She can comfortably speak loud enough that he can actually catch what she says, and he is an excellent source of both stories, instruction and sausage. But when he pushes back on her worst excesses, it hurts. He's one of few older authority figures in her life that's actually given a damn, but his philosophy is that there's a time and a place for the big voice, and restraint should be the default. So while they like each other and he wants her to succeed, he's also the first to berate her when she's shouted the merchant's canary to an early grave, or adlibbed a howling choir with the mongrels. One single time, when properly drunk, he mentioned an old myth to Yawp: The Shout that Moves the Heavens. Then, he demonstrated the power of his own old shout, like an opera singer teaching the new generation. Yawp is still hanging on to the memory.</p> </li> <li> <p>Alma Tennant: Alma runs a well-kept bathhouse at a crossroads town that sees more travelers than it should, and far more secrets than it admits. She first employed Yawp as a courier and errand-runner, quickly recognizing both her raw energy and her inexperience, and began offering her regular work, warm meals, and a place to land without ever naming it as such. What began as a strictly instrumental relationship turned warm with surprising speed, as Alma took on a quiet guiding role that Yawp never asked for but fiercely values. Yawp trusts Alma implicitly, and in some ways she's like the mother figure Yawp hasn't had in a long time.</p> </li> </ul> Notes for the DM Mechanical build (lv 5) and PDF download STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA 8 (-1) 16 (+3) 14 (+2) 10 (+0) 8 (-1) 18 (+4) Session Zero Considerations <p>Content Notes: Check language levels and vibes with the table. Yawp is written as a PG-13+ character, unapologetically rowdy and unrestrained. Contains themes of childhood abandonment, twelve years of enforced isolation and silence, and brief sexual betrayal (non-graphic). Explores the line between demanding recognition and demanding submission. Claustrophobia and involuntary silence may be explored if DM and player agree. The character has potential for a villain arc if her need to be heard crosses into silencing others. If your table leans more toward heroic fantasy, Yawp may still be a great fit with adjustments to tone.</p> <p>Representation Notes: Possible case of adoption or childhood lies about provenance.

She was willowy where Goliaths were broad, her frame refusing to bulk up no matter how much she ate or trained. Worse, she had hair\u2014thick, wild, impossible amounts of it that kept growing in defiance of every Goliath aesthetic. The whispers started early: Is she even pure-blood? What's wrong with her?</p> <p>At six, the tribe found a use for the odd one. She was sent away as a diplomatic hostage, sealing a fragile peace between her Goliath tribe and a high elven research enclave in the mountains. Her parents called it \"a necessary sacrifice\", but the decision to not let her grow up among the Goliaths had a utilitarian ring to it.</p> <p>The sanctuary and research station, perched on cold and remote crags, was her prison for twelve years. The elven scholars enchanted the stone walls to absorb all sound, protecting their delicate experiments from disruption. Cuma'ra never understood what their \"forbidden acoustics\" research was about. Instead, she learned elven scripture and etiquette under suffocating arches where even her heartbeat echoed in her ears. The scholars barely saw her as a person, just another diplomatic obligation\u2014a body to park in the library with a stack of books and expectations of silence. When she didn't comply, they simply carried out their wills with spells, robbing the young girl of her voice for days on end. Every night she lay in bed with that Silence spell robbing her voice, she listened to her heartbeats. The one sound her body refused to give up.</p> <p>She wondered if her family even thought about her, or if they'd simply been relieved to ship off the child who didn't fit. And then, she longed to scream into the wind. For twelve years, her whole childhood and teens, she compressed. Survived. Remained. She read all the epics of heroes of olden days, of people who would not be chained no matter the price. Her timeless captors hardly seemed to notice how she changed, how her gaze turned hard and purposeful.</p> <p>Soon after she turned eighteen, Thymeon the Pilgrim cracked the Sanctuary walls. A visiting bard who claimed to see the \"wild sky\" shimmering inside her, he was the first person in years who spoke to her like she had a will of her own. His flattery was clumsy, his poems worse, but when he offered to use his spells to abscond with her under a moonlit sky, she stood ready with her bags in ten minutes.</p> <p>That night was heady with laughter, music and the breathless sensation of open air in every direction. And yes, the man was attractive enough. But in the morning, the space beside her was empty, her meager savings gone, and the road stretching out in both directions.</p> <p>Cuma'ra sat with that betrayal for a full day before making her choice. She wouldn't return to the Sanctuary in defeat. She wouldn't honor her family with reaching out. She certainly wouldn't collapse under the weight of the world she had longed so long to meet. Turning the page on a childhood largely unlived, she shed her birth name forever and vowed to meet life like a collision. She would be Yawp, a shouty word she'd read and giggled at in some dusty old tome as a little girl. It didn't even sound like a proper name, but it could serve as a promise.</p> <p>The months that followed were her real education, and she attended every lesson. She traveled with suspicious caravans, danced with dangerously under-supervised fire elementals, hilariously lost multiple drinking contests with the local orc tribe, snuck into Noble Estates to raid the pantry with the street children, and migrated across the mountains with Stone giants, learning their deep drum rhythms on the way. And even when she woke to skull-splitting headaches, ran from ambushes or starved on the wayside, playing the lute for coppers, she treasured every second. Even if she died on these roads, she would do it as a free woman.</p> <p>Half a year later, fate brought her face-to-face with Thymeon again, this time on the wrong end of a hanging rope for seducing a mayor's daughter. Instead of leaving him to swing, she saw her chance to prove herself bigger than his petty betrayal. She bargained for his release,reclaimed her stolen belongings and in a moment of poetic justice claimed his prized bagpipes as her trophy. They've been her noisemaker of choice ever since. Thymeon himself is still out there somewhere, but she made it abundantly clear when they parted: if she learned he'd gone after other girls the way he did with her, they would have words.</p>"},{"location":"character_concepts/yawp-cumuluni/#personality","title":"Personality","text":"<p>Yawp is not a typical bard \"seducer\" or solitary drifter. She's a force of nature, making up for twelve years of stolen voice with every blaring note. She steps into any scene or fight as if she's fronting a heavy metal concert: full intention, full force, no compromise. She has thick, ropy dreadlock hair, rare for most species, especially Goliaths. She flaunts it proudly, with massive headbanging and windmilling whenever the opportunity arises\u2014which often means anytime there's downtime and a tavern is nearby. Yawp parties hard, and not in the regular bardic debauchery sense. She may be willowy, but she's still a 7'5\" Goliath. Furniture will break. Hard liquor will run out. Fires will be started. Good news is, if she likes you, she will be the best damn wingman you never asked for.</p> <p>Twelve years of enforced quiet didn't break her, it just taught her how to keep existing in the middle of being erased. That's her reservoir of controlled fury she taps into whenever she needs to remember what she's capable of. Those moments when she goes quiet, she's remembering the person who stared down twelve years of erasure and said \"no, I'm still here.\"</p> <p>Still, that time left its indelible marks. Yawp has developed severe claustrophobia. She will never willingly be restrained, and will likely have to pass Wisdom saving throws to go into too confined spaces, at the DM's discretion. Imagine this as her worst moments at the Sanctuary, only accompanied by the sound of her heartbeats. In those intense moments, that is still all she hears. </p> <p>She also gets \"stage fright\"\u2014tongue-tying in moments of genuine intimacy and emotional vulnerability. When someone gets that close, she cranks the volume and dances away. Perhaps it's her claustrophobia, fear of being bound, or her body remembers her family's betrayal. She doesn't talk about it often, but sometimes when she sees happy families, her smile gets somewhat forced.</p> <p>She dreams of finding the highest peak in the world to shout from. Not for the poetry or beauty of it, but as an ultimate statement of existence. Proof that she matters enough to leave a mark the world cannot ignore. The Sanctuary absorbed her voice for twelve years. Her family gave her away. Thymeon took what he wanted and left. She wants to make a sound of such might that the whole skies themselves must echo it back.

He'd watched the forest suffer for the vanity of two humans who thought sentience was a gift.</p> <p>So he chose extinction over consciousness. He made his attempt to call off the hunt, got rejected, disappeared while they were still being herded in circles, and used whatever head start that bought him to do the only thing left that his old body could accomplish.
